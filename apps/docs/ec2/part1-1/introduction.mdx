### 0.1 Introduction to the Eurocodes

The Structural Eurocodes comprise the following standards generally consisting of a number of Parts:

- EN 1990, Eurocode: Basis of structural and geotechnical design
- EN 1991, Eurocode 1: Actions on structures
- EN 1992, Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures
- EN 1993, Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures
- EN 1994, Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures
- EN 1995, Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures
- EN 1996, Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures
- EN 1997, Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design
- EN 1998, Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance
- EN 1999, Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures
- New parts are under development, e.g. Eurocode for design of structural glass.

The Eurocodes are intended for use by designers, clients, manufacturers, constructors, relevant authorities (in exercising their duties in accordance with national or international regulations), educators, software developers, and committees drafting standards for related product, testing and execution standards.

NOTE Some aspects of design are most appropriately specified by relevant authorities or, where not specified, can be agreed on a project-specific basis between relevant parties such as designers and clients. The Eurocodes identify such aspects making explicit reference to relevant authorities and relevant parties.

### 0.2 Introduction to EN 1992 (all parts)

(1) EN 1992 applies to the design of buildings, bridges and civil engineering structures in plain, reinforced and prestressed concrete. It complies with the principles and requirements for the safety and serviceability of structures, the basis of their design and verification that are given in EN 1990, Basis of structural and geotechnical design.
(2) EN 1992 is only concerned with the requirements for resistance, serviceability, durability and fire resistance of concrete structures. Other requirements, e.g. concerning thermal or sound insulation, are not considered.
(3) EN 1992 is subdivided into various parts:

- EN 1992-1-1, Design of concrete structures - Part 1-1: General rules and rules for buildings, bridges and civil engineering structures,
- EN 1992-1-2, Désign of concréte strúctures - Part 1-2: Structural fire design,
- EN 1992-4, Design of concrete structures - Part 4: Design of fastenings for use in concrete.


### 0.3 Introduction to EN 1992-1-1

(1) EN 1992-1-1 describes the principles and requirements for safety, serviceability and durability of concrete structures. It is based on the limit state concept used in conjunction with a partial factor method.
(2) EN 1992-1-1 also serves as a reference document for other CEN TCs concerning structural matters.
(3) Numerical values for partial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that provide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an appropriate level of workmanship and of quality management applies. When FprEN 1992-1-1 is used as a base document by other CEN/TCs the same values need to be taken.

### 0.4 Verbal forms used in the Eurocodes

The verb "shall" expresses a requirement strictly to be followed and from which no deviation is permitted in order to comply with the Eurocodes.

The verb "should" expresses a highly recommended choice or course of action. Subject to national regulation and/or any relevant contractual provisions, alternative approaches could be used/adopted where technically justified.

The verb "may" expresses a course of action permissible within the limits of the Eurocodes.
The verb "can" expresses possibility and capability; it is used for statements of fact and clarification of concepts.

### 0.5 National Annex for EN 1992-1-1

National choice is allowed in this document where explicitly stated within notes. National choice includes the selection of values for Nationally Determined Parameters (NDPs).

The national standard implementing EN 1992-1-1 can have a National Annex containing all national choices to be used for the design of buildings, bridges and civil engineering works to be constructed in the relevant country.

When no national choice is given, the default choice given in this document is to be used.
When no national choice is made and no default is given in this document, the choice can be specified by a relevant authority or, where not specified, agreed for a specific project by appropriate parties.

National choice is allowed in EN 1992-1-1 through notes to the following:
