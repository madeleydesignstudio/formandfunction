NOTE 1 All strength classes apply unless the National Annex excludes specific classes.
NOTE 2 Intermediate strength classes can be used, if included in the National Annex.
NOTE 3 The relationship between cube strength and cylinder strength is covered in EN 206.
NOTE 4 For restrictions on the scope of application of Table 5.1 to lightweight concrete or recycled aggregate concrete, refer to Annex M and Annex N, respectively.

NOTE 5 The design clauses of SLS and for minimum reinforcement make allowance for an over-strength of tensile strength in a class between $f_{\text {cttk; } 0,05}$ and $f_{\text {ctk; } 0,95 \text {.......,.,......,.,...... }}$
(4) If required, the concrete compressive strength $f_{\mathrm{ck}}(t)$, should be specified for times $t$ that can be before or after $t_{\text {ref }}$ for a number of stages (e.g. demoulding, removal of propping, transfer of prestress).
(5) Where concrete tensile strength is tested and documented at the same frequency as for compressive strength, a statistical analysis of test results may be used as a basis for the evaluation of the tensile strength $f_{\mathrm{ctk}, 0,05}, f_{\mathrm{ctk}, 0,95}$ and $f_{\mathrm{ctm}}$, as an alternative to Table 5.1.
(6) Unless verified by testing, the development of concrete strength with time, temperature, curing conditions and binder composition should be estimated according to Annex B.

### 5.1.4 Elastic deformation

(1) The values of the elastic modulus of concrete should be specified and/or determined by testing if the structure is likely to be sensitive to deviations from the approximate indicative values given in (2).

NOTE The elastic deformations of concrete largely depend on its composition (especially the aggregates).
(2) Approximate indicative values for the modulus of elasticity $E_{\mathrm{cm}}$ may be taken as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{cm}}=k_{\mathrm{E}} \cdot f_{\mathrm{cm}^{1 / 3}} \tag{5.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

For concrete with quartzite aggregates $k_{\mathrm{E}}=9500$ may be assumed. For other types of aggregates $k_{\mathrm{E}}$ can vary between 5000 and 13000 .

NOTE 1 The National Annex can specify values $k_{\mathrm{E}}$ to be used in the country.
NOTE $2 E_{\mathrm{cm}}$ corresponds to the secant modulus between $\sigma_{\mathrm{c}}=0$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{c}}=0,4 f_{\mathrm{cm}}$.
(3) Poisson's ratio may be taken equal to 0,2 for uncracked concrete and 0 for concrete cracked in tension.

### 5.1.5 Creep and shrinkage

(1) The creep deformation of concrete $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cc}}\left(t, t_{0}\right)$ at time $t$ for a constant compressive stress $\sigma_{\mathrm{c}}$ applied at the concrete age $t_{0}$, shall be given by:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cc}}\left(t, t_{0}\right)=\varphi\left(t, t_{0}\right) \cdot\left(\sigma_{\mathrm{c}} / E_{\mathrm{c}, 28}\right) \tag{5.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$E_{\mathrm{c}, 28}$ is the tangent modulus of elasticity, which may be taken as $1,05 E_{\mathrm{cm}}$, or calculated more accurately from Formula (B.21) or determined by testing.

NOTE Creep and shrinkage of the concrete depend on the ambient humidity, the dimensions of the element, the composition of the concrete and curing conditions. Creep is also influenced by the maturity of the concrete when the load is first applied and depends on the duration and magnitude of the loading.
(2) If the compressive stress of concrete at an age $t_{0}$ does not exceed $0,40 f_{\mathrm{cm}}\left(t_{0}\right)$ under the quasipermanent combination of actions and where great accuracy is not required, the values given in Table 5.2 may be considered as the creep coefficient $\varphi\left(50 \mathrm{y}, t_{0}\right)$ for plain concrete. Where more accurate predictions of creep are needed or where the design service life of a structure is greater than 50 years, Annex B should be used.

NOTE Annex B provides further information and guidance, including the development of the modulus of elasticity with time and the development of creep with time.

For other strength in the range of $12 \mathrm{MPa} \leq f_{\mathrm{ck}, 28} \leq 100 \mathrm{MPa}$, the values should be multiplied by the factor $\left(35 / f_{\mathrm{ck}}\right)^{\mathrm{A}}$ where $A$ is the correction exponent in the table, considering the effect of the concrete strength class. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| NOTE The creep coefficients are mean values with a coefficient of variation of about $30 \%$. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

(3) When the compressive stress at age $t_{0}$ exceeds the value $0,40 f_{\mathrm{cm}}\left(t_{0}\right)$ under the quasi-permanent combination of actions then creep non-linearity should be considered. In such cases the non-linear notional creep coefficient should be obtained according to Annex B.
(4) Values for total shrinkage after 50 years are given in Table 5.3 (NDP) for plain concrete. Where a more accurate shrinkage prediction is required, Annex B should be used.
NOTE The values in Table 5.3 (NDP) apply unless the National Annex gives different values.

### 5.1.6 Design assumptions

(1) The value of the design compressive strength shall be taken as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\mathrm{cd}}=\eta_{\mathrm{cc}} \cdot k_{\mathrm{tc}} \frac{f_{\mathrm{ck}}}{\gamma_{\mathrm{C}}} \tag{5.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$\eta_{\mathrm{cc}} \quad$ is a factor to account for the difference between the undisturbed compressive strength of a cylinder and the effective compressive strength that can be developed in the structural member. It shall be taken as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{\mathrm{cc}}=\left(\frac{f_{\mathrm{ck}, \mathrm{ref}}}{f_{\mathrm{ck}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \leq 1,0 \tag{5.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

$k_{\mathrm{tc}} \quad$ is a factor considering the effect of high sustained loads and of time of loading on concrete compressive strength.

NOTE The following values apply unless the National Annex gives different values:

- $f_{\mathrm{ck}, \mathrm{ref}}=40 \mathrm{MPa}$;
- $\quad k_{\mathrm{tc}}=1,00$ for $t_{\text {ref }} \leq 28$ days for concretes with classes CR and CN and $t_{\text {ref }} \leq 56$ days for concretes with class CS where the design loading is not expected for at least 3 months after casting;
- $\quad k_{\mathrm{tc}}=0,85$ for other cases including when $f_{\mathrm{ck}}$ is replaced by $f_{\mathrm{ck}}(\mathrm{t})$ in accordance with 5.1.3(4).
(2) The value of the design tensile strength $f_{\text {ctd }}$ shall be taken as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\mathrm{ctd}}=k_{\mathrm{tt}} \frac{f_{\mathrm{ctk}, 0,05}}{\gamma_{\mathrm{C}}} \tag{5.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$k_{\mathrm{tt}} \quad$ is a factor considering the effect of high sustained loads and of time of loading on concrete tensile strength.

NOTE The value is $k_{\mathrm{tt}}=0,80$ for $t_{\mathrm{ref}} \leq 28$ days for concretes with classes CR and CN and $t_{\mathrm{ref}} \leq 56$ days for concretes with class CS, and $k_{\mathrm{tt}}=0,70$ for other cases including when $f_{\mathrm{ck}}(t)$ is determined in accordance with 5.1.3(4) unless the National Annex gives different values.
(3) The relation between compressive stress $\sigma_{\mathrm{c}}$ and strain $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{c}}$ shown in Figure 5.1 and described by the Formula (5.6) may be used to model the response of concrete to short term uniaxial compréssion."

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{c}}}{f_{\mathrm{cm}}}=\frac{k \eta-\eta^{2}}{1+(k-2) \eta}  \tag{5.6}\\
& k=1,05 E_{\mathrm{cm}} \cdot \varepsilon_{\mathrm{c} 1} / f_{\mathrm{cm}}  \tag{5.7}\\
& \eta=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{c}} / \varepsilon_{\mathrm{c} 1}  \tag{5.8}\\
& \varepsilon_{\mathrm{c} 1}[\% 0]=0,7 f_{\mathrm{cm}} 1 / 3 \leq 2,8 \% 0  \tag{5.9}\\
& \varepsilon_{\mathrm{c}}<\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cu} 1}[\% 0]=2,8+14 \cdot\left(1-f_{\mathrm{cm}} / 108\right)^{4} \leq 3,5 \% 0 \tag{5.10}
\end{align*}
$$

NOTE Simplified stress distributions in cross-sections used to determine the resistance to axial and flexural effects at the ultimate limit state are provided in 8.1.2.
(4) Other idealised stress-strain relations may be applied, if they adequately represent the behaviour of the concrete considered.
(5) Unless more precise values are available, the mean unit weight of normal weight reinforced concrete for the purposes of design may be taken as $25 \mathrm{kN} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$, and for plain normal weight concrete as $24 \mathrm{kN} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$.
(6) Unless more accurate information is available, the linear coefficient of thermal expansion may be taken as $\alpha_{\mathrm{c}, \text { th }}=10 \cdot 10^{-6}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$.

(3) Prestressing steel suitable for design of concrete structures in accordance with this Eurocode shall satisfy the requirements of C.5.
(4) More accurate information based on production data of the prestressing steel may be used in design such as e.g. stress-strain diagrams, modulus of elasticity and isothermal stress relaxation.

### 5.3.3 Design assumptions

(1) Design shall be based on the nominal cross-section area of the prestressing steel and the design values derived from the characteristic values given in 5.3.2 with:

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\mathrm{pd}}=f_{\mathrm{p} 0,1 \mathrm{k}} / \gamma_{\mathrm{S}} \tag{5.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

(2) For design, either of the following assumptions may be made (see Figure 5.3):
a) an inclined post-elastic branch, with a strain limit $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ud}} \leq \varepsilon_{\mathrm{uk}} / \gamma_{\mathrm{s}}$ and a maximum stress of $f_{\mathrm{pk}} / \gamma_{\mathrm{s}}$ at $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{uk}}$;
b) or a horizontal post-elastic branch without strain limit.

(3) The design value for the modulus of elasticity $E_{\mathrm{p}}$ may be assumed to be 200000 MPa . If more accurate values are required, values based on testing should be used.

NOTE The actual value of the E-modulus for wires is 205000 MPa . For strands it can range from 190000 MPa to 200000 MPa , depending on the manufacturing process and the geometrical configuration of the prestressing steel. For bars, the modulus is 205000 MPa however, the secant modulus between 0 and $0,7 f_{\mathrm{pk}}$. can be as low as 170000 MPa depending on the manufacturing process.
(4) The mean unit weight of prestressing steel for the purposes of design may be taken as $78,5 \mathrm{kN} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$.
(5) The coefficient of thermal expansion may be taken as $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{th}}=10 \cdot 10^{-6}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$ for prestressing steel unless more precise values are known.
(6) The relaxation loss may be obtained either from Table B.4, from the relevant standard for prestressing steel or may be based on testing and adapted for the effects of initial stress and time in accordance with Annex B. 9 where required.

### 5.4 Prestressing systems

### 5.4.1 General

(1) Prestressing systems including tendon anchorage assemblies and tendon coupler assemblies used for design of concrete structures in accordance with this Eurocode shall comply with the relevant standards for prestressing systems.

NOTE 1 The National Annex can specify relevant standards for prestressing systems.
NOTE 2 EAD 160004 is available for the assessment and determination of properties of prestressing systems required for design to this Eurocode.
(2) As a minimum the following information shall be provided in the technical documentation of the post-tensioning systems as basis for the design of concrete structures in accordance with this Eurocode:

- product type and properties of prestressing steel;
- types of applications of tendons;
- types and dimensions of ducts, anchorages and tendon couplers;
- arrangement and detailing of tendon supports;
- minimum spacing and edge distances of anchorages and tendon couplers with corresponding local anchorage zone reinforcement as a function of concrete strength;
- minimum radii of tendon curvature;
- friction coefficients;
- anchorage seating;
- details for corrosion protection as a function of the tendon protection level.
(3) Prestressing tendons shall be adequately and permanently protected against corrosion along the tendon length and at anchorages.
(4) Internal bonded post-tensioning tendons may be provided with different levels of corrosion protection:
- Protection Level 1: Tendon grouted within a metal duct;
- Protection Level 2: Tendon fully encapsulated within a grouted polymer duct and anchorage caps;
- Protection Level 3: Tendon fully encapsulated within a grouted polymer duct and anchorage caps and encapsulation monitorable with electrical resistance measurement or equivalent methods.

NOTE Guidance for the assessment of tendon protection levels and polymer ducts can be found in fib Bulletin 75.

### 5.4.2 Anchorage zones

(1) The strength of the anchorage and coupling devices and anchorage zones shall be sufficient for the transfer of the design tendon force at ULS to the concrete. The formation of cracks in the anchorage zones shall not impair the function of the anchorage and coupling device. These requirements may be assumed to be complied with if:

- detailing of the local anchorage zones is in accordance with the technical documentation of a posttensioning system which complies with 5.4.1(1);
- design and detailing of the general anchorage zones is in accordance with 11.6.4.
