title: 'Durability and Concrete Cover'
---

### 6.1 General

(1) A durable structure shall meet the requirements of serviceability, strength and stability throughout its design service life, without significant loss of utility, with anticipated maintenance but without major repair being necessary, in line with the general requirements of EN 1990.
(2) The required protection against deterioration of the structure shall be established by considering environmental conditions, intended use, design service life, maintenance programme and actions.
(3) Concrete structures complying with the provisions of this standard, EN 206 and EN 13670 are assumed to be sufficiently durable. Requirements for durability should be considered in addition to SLS and ULS.

NOTE 1 For the purpose of assessing durability, end of design service life is considered to have been reached when there is corrosion attack in the reinforcement and/or loss of concrete thickness or strength of the structural element, to an extent that impairs its performance.

NOTE 2 Corrosion attack can be judged by loss of bar diameter in the case of carbonation attack and pitting depth in the reinforcement in the case of chloride attack.
(4) The possible significance of direct and indirect actions (like temperature, shrinkage and creep), environmental conditions and consequential effects shall be considered.
(5) Corrosion protection of steel reinforcement should be provided by controlling quality of concrete, thickness and extent of cracking of the concrete in the cover zone.
(6) Where metal fastenings are not fully embedded in concrete with sufficient cover, they should be of corrosion resistant material. Where it is possible to inspect and replace or repair them, fastenings with protective coating may be used in exposed conditions.
(7) Further requirements to those given in this clause should be considered for special situations (e.g. for structures of temporary or monumental nature, structures subjected to extreme or unusual actions or extraordinary exposure conditions, etc.).

### 6.2 Requirements for durability

(1) In order to achieve the required design service life of the structure, adequate measures shall be taken to protect each concrete member against the relevant environmental actions.
(2) The requirements for durability shall be considered at all stages, including:

- structural conception;
- material selection;
- construction details;
- execution;
- quality management;
- life-time maintenance.
(3) Special measures may be considered (e.g. coatings of concrete surface, cathodic protection, corrosion inhibitors or reinforcing steel with metallic or non-metallic coatings). For such situations, the effects on all relevant material properties and design parameters should be considered, including bond. For stainless steel, the provisions in Annex Q shall be used.


### 6.3 Environmental exposure conditions

(1) The environmental exposure conditions are those chemical, physical and biological conditions to which the structure is exposed (additional to the mechanical actions). The exposure conditions can be different on the various surfaces or elevations of a concrete member, and consequently while the concrete shall meet the relevant requirements, the requirements for cover to the reinforcement and the limitation of cracking may be different.
(2) All relevant forms of attack on the structure shall be taken into account. The forms of attack include:

- alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR);
- biological attacks arising from e.g.:
- algae;
- vegetation;
- chemical attacks arising from e.g. from soil, ground water or the use of the structure (storage of liquids, etc.):
- acid solutions;
- soft water;
- sulfates;
- other chemicals;
- delayed ettringite formation (DEF);
- physical attack, arising from e.g.:
- abrasion;
- temperature change (including freeze/thaw);
- water penetration;
- reinforcement corrosion due to carbonation or chlorides ingress;
- reinforcement corrosion that can be due to chlorides present in concrete before exposure;
- stress corrosion cracking.
(3) Table 6.1 defines exposure classes X for the most common environmental exposure conditions.

NOTE 1 Guidance for the selection of the exposure classes (e.g. the duration of the exposure, limits for RH in the XC classes or limits for the chloride contents in the XD and XS classes as well as classification of the freeze/thaw climate in the XF classes and any additional categories) can be found in the place of use of the concrete, based on local geographical and climatic conditions, the operational practices and levels of protection at national level.

NOTE 2 Table 6.1 provides examples where exposure classes occur unless the National Annex provides other examples or requirements for the selection of exposure classes.

Table 6.1 - Exposure classes related to environmental conditions
| Class | Description of the environment | Informative examples where exposure classes can occur (NDP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. No risk of corrosion or attack |  |  |
| For concrete without reinforcement or embedded metal: |  |  |
| X0 | All exposures except where there is freeze/thaw, abrasion or chemical attack. | Plain concrete members without any reinforcement. |
| 2. Corrosion of embedded metal induced by carbonation |  |  |
| Where concrete containing steel reinforcement or other embedded metal is exposed to air and moisture, the exposure should be classified as follows: |  |  |
| XC1 | Dry. | Concrete inside buildings with low air humidity, where the corrosion rate will be insignificant. |
| XC2 | Wet or permanent high humidity, rarely dry. | Concrete surfaces subject to long-term water contact or permanently submerged in water or permanently exposed to high humidity; many foundations; water containments (not external). <br> NOTE 1 Leaching could also cause corrosion (see (5), and (6), XA classes). |
| XC3 | Moderate humidity. | Concrete inside buildings with moderate humidity and not permanent high humidity; External concrete sheltered from rain. |
| XC4 | Cyclic wet and dry. | Concrete surfaces subject to cyclic water contact (e.g. external concrete not sheltered from rain as walls and facades). |
| 3. Corrosion of embedded metal induced by chlorides, excluding sea water |  |  |
| Where concrete containing steel reinforcement or other embedded metal is subject to contact with water containing chlorides, including de-icing salts, from sources other than from sea water, the exposure should be classified as follows: |  |  |
| XD1 | Moderate humidity | Concrete surfaces exposed to airborne chlorides. |
| XD2 | Wet, rarely dry. | Swimming pools; <br> Concrete components exposed to industrial waters containing chlorides. <br> NOTE 2 If the chloride content of the water is sufficiently low then XD1 applies. |
| XD3 | Cyclic wet and dry. | Parts of bridges exposed to water containing chlorides; <br> Concrete roads, pavements and car park slabs in areas where de-icing agents are frequently used. |


| Class | Description of the environment | Informative examples where exposure classes can occur (NDP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4. Corrosion of embedded metal induced by chlorides from sea water |  |  |
| Where concrete containing steel reinforcement or other embedded metal is subject to contact with chlorides from sea water or air carrying salt originating from sea water, the exposure should be classified as follows: |  |  |
| XS1 | Exposed to airborne salt but not in direct contact with sea water. | Structures near to or on the coast. |
| XS2 | Permanently submerged. | Parts of marine structures and structures in seawater. |
| XS3 | Tidal, splash and spray zones. | Parts of marine structures and structures temporarily or permanently directly over sea water. |
| 5. Freeze/Thaw Attack |  |  |
| Where concrete is exposed to significant attack by freeze/thaw cycles whilst wet, the exposure should be classified as follows. A XF-classification is not necessary in cases where freeze/thaw cycles are rare. |  |  |
| XF1 | Moderate water saturation, without de-icing agent. | Vertical concrete surfaces exposed to rain and freezing. |
| XF2 | Moderate water saturation, with de-icing agent. | Vertical concrete surfaces of road structures exposed to freezing and airborne de-icing agents. |
| XF3 | High water saturation, without de-icing agents. | Horizontal concrete surfaces exposed to rain and freezing. |
| XF4 | High water saturation with de-icing agents or sea water. | Road and bridge decks exposed to de-icing agents and freezing; <br> concrete surfaces exposed to direct spray containing de-icing agents and freezing; splash zone of marine structures exposed to freezing. |
| 6. Chemical attack |  |  |
| Where concrete is exposed to chemical attack from natural soils and ground water, the exposure should be classified as follows: |  |  |
| XA1 | Slightly aggressive chemical environment. | Natural soils and ground water according to Table 6.2. |
| XA2 | Moderately aggressive chemical environment. | Natural soils and ground water according to Table 6.2. |
| XA3 | Highly aggressive chemical environment. | Natural soils and ground water according to Table 6.2. |
| 7. Mechanical attack of concrete by abrasion |  |  |
| Where concrete is exposed to mechanical abrasion, the exposure should be classified as follows: |  |  |
| XM1 | Moderate abrasion. | Members of industrial sites frequented by vehicles with pneumatic tyres. |
| XM2 | Heavy abrasion. | Members of industrial sites frequented by fork lifts with pneumatic or solid rubber tyres. |
| XM3 | Extreme abrasion: ${ }^{\prime} \cdots, \ldots, \ldots, \ldots, \ldots, \ldots, \ldots, \ldots, \ldots$ | Members of industrial sites frequented by fork lifts with elastomer or steel tyres or track vehicles. |

(4) In addition to the exposure conditions in Table 6.1, the other particular forms of aggressive or indirect action according to (2) and (6) shall be considered.
(5) Classification of the exposure with respect to natural chemical attack from the soil and ground water should refer to Table 6.2, the validity of which is ensured in the case of natural soil and ground water at water/soil temperatures between $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and a water velocity sufficiently slow to approximate to static conditions. The most onerous value for any single chemical characteristic determines the class. Where two or more aggressive characteristics lead to the same class, the environment should be classified into the next higher class unless a special study for this specific case proves that it is not necessary.

NOTE 1 Guidance on the selection of exposure classes for chemical attack from natural soil and ground water and any additional categories can be found in the place of use of the concrete based on local ground conditions and levels of protection at national level.

NOTE 2 The exposure classes of Table 6.2 apply unless the National Annex specifies additional exposure clàsses and limiting values for chemical attack.
(6) In the case of chemical attack, a special study may be needed to establish the relevant exposure conditions and appropriate protective measures, where there is:

- values outside the limiting values of Table 6.2;
- leaching, e.g. due to long-term contact to (soft) water or other liquids (see also XC2);
- other aggressive chemicals;
- chemically polluted ground or water;
- high water velocity in combination with the chemicals in Table 6.2.

Table 6.2 - Limiting values for exposure classes for chemical attack from natural soil and ground water
| Chemical characteristic | Reference test method | XA1 | XA2 | XA3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Groundwater |  |  |  |  |
| $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}[\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{l}]$ | EN 196-2 | $\geq 200$ and $\leq 600$ | > 600 and $\leq 3000$ | > 3000 and $\leq 6000$ |

| Acidity according to Baumann Gully [ml/kg] | EN 16502 | > 200 | Not encountered in practice |  |
| a Clay soils with a permeability below $10^{-5} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ may be moved into a lower class. <br> ${ }^{\text {b }}$ The test method prescribes the extraction of $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ by hydrochloric acid; alternatively, water extraction may be used, if experience is available in the place of use of the concrete. <br> c The $3000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ limit should be reduced to $2000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, where there is a risk of accumulation of sulfate ions in the concrete due to drying and wetting cycles or capillary suction. |  |  |  |  |


### 6.4 Exposure resistance classes

(1) Exposure resistance classes ERC should be used to classify concrete with respect to resistance against corrosion induced by carbonation (class XRC) or by chlorides (class XRDS) and damage caused by freeze/thaw attack (XRF). Selection of concrete to resist deterioration and protect against corrosion for all those exposure classes (EC) that are relevant, should be based on the exposure resistance classes given in EN 206.

NOTE 1 As specified in EN 206, complemented by the provisions valid in the place of use, the ERC can be satisfied by compliance with relevant limiting values and/or, for some ERCs, by proving the performance in meeting specification of relevant physical characteristics determined using standardized test methods. In the event EN 206 does not refer to ERC, the National Annex or National Application Document to EN 206 can provide the necessary advice on how to implement ERC rules in a country.

NOTE 2 An informative Annex P provides an alternative approach to design cover for durability without use of Exposure Resistance Classes (ERC) based on EN 1992-1-1:2004. The use of ERC according to 6.4 applies unless the National Annex specifies use of Annex P..
(2) The structural design should be based on a realistic concrete strength class consistent with the required exposure resistance class ERC.

NOTE The composition of the concrete, e.g. the type of binder and the water-binder ratio, affects simultaneously the durability, physical and mechanical properties of the concrete. A choice based on the protection of reinforcement can lead to higher strength classes than required for the structural design and hence, can require higher minimum reinforcement and other measures.
(3) Adequate durability may be assumed against corrosion caused by carbonation or chloride ingress where cover to reinforcement is selected appropriate to the exposure class, exposure resistance class and the design service life and not less than the minimum cover for durability $c_{\text {min, dur }}$ given in Table 6.3 (NDP) and Table 6.4 (NDP).
(4) Concrete shall be specified with a maximum permitted chloride content in accordance with the chloride content classes (Cl) in EN 206.
(5) Concrete to resist freeze-thaw attack shall be specified using XRF classes according to EN 206.
(6) Adequate durability against chemical attack may be assumed when concrete with a composition documented to be resistant against the potential deterioration mechanisms for the intended design service life is used. Otherwise additional protective measures should be taken, such as linings or durable/replaceable coating.

NOTE Rules on concrete composition to resist the chemical attacks detailed in Table 6.2 are given in EN 206 or in its national application document.
(7) Adequate durability against mechanical attack may be assumed when concrete with a composition documented to be resistant against the potential abrasion for the intended design service life is used. Otherwise additional protective measures should be taken, such as sacrificial layers according to 6.5.2.2(6).

NOTE Rules on concrete composition to resist the mechanical attacks detailed in Table 6.1 can be given in EN 206 or in its national application document.

### 6.5 Concrete cover

### 6.5.1 Nominal cover

(1) The nominal cover shall be specified in the execution specification. It is defined as a minimum cover, $c_{\text {min }}$ (see 6.5.2), plus an allowance in design for deviation, $\Delta c_{\text {dev }}$ (see 6.5.3):

$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{\mathrm{nom}}=c_{\min }+\Delta c_{\mathrm{dev}} \tag{6.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

(2) Sufficient concrete cover shall be provided in order to ensure:

- the safe transmission of bond forces;
- the protection of the steel against corrosion (durability);
- an adequate fire resistance (see EN 1992-1-2, where axis distance is used).
(3) For bored piles and for diaphragm walls the nominal cover values for durability and bond of this Eurocode apply. The cover values according to EN 1536 and EN 1538 considering the type and deviations of execution should be checked additionally. The largest value according to this Eurocode and EN 1536 or EN 1538 applies.


### 6.5.2 Minimum cover

### 6.5.2.1 General

(1) The value for $c_{\text {min }}$ shall satisfy the requirements for both bond and durability:

$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{\min }=\max \left\{c_{\min , \mathrm{dur}}+\Sigma \Delta c ; c_{\min , \mathrm{b}} ; 10 \mathrm{~mm}\right\} \tag{6.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

| $\boldsymbol{C}_{\text {min,dur }}$ | minimum cover required for environmental conditions, see 6.5.2.2; |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\Sigma \Delta c$ | sum of the following applicable reductions and additions: |
|  | $\Delta c_{\text {min,30 }}$ reduction of minimum cover for structures with design life of 30 years or less, see 6.5.2.2(2); |
|  | $\Delta c_{\text {min, exc }}$ reduction of minimum cover for superior compaction or improved curing, see 6.5.2.2(3); |
|  | $\Delta c_{\text {min,p }} \quad$ additional minimum cover for prestressing tendons, see 6.5.2.2(4); |
|  | $\Delta c_{\text {dur,red1 }}$ and $\Delta c_{\text {dur, red2 }}$ <br> reduction of minimum cover for use of additional concrete protection or use of special measures for protection of reinforcing steel, see 6.5.2.2(5) and 6.5.2.2(9); |
|  | $\Delta c_{\text {dur,abr }} \quad$ additional minimum cover for abrasion, see 6.5.2.2(6); |
| $C_{\text {min, } \mathrm{b}}$ | minimum cover for bond requirement, see 6.5.2.3. |

(2) For concrete cast directly against soil surface, the minimum cover should be increased by $\Delta c_{\text {min }}$ considering the increased uncertainty and variability of concrete and the reduced compaction against soil.

NOTE The increase of the cover is $\Delta c_{\min }=+5 \mathrm{~mm}$ for casting against a vertical soil surface and $\Delta c_{\min }=0 \mathrm{~mm}$ for a horizontal soil ground surface unless the National Annex gives other values.
(3) Minimum cover to post-installed reinforcing bars with respect to the transfer of bond forces and durability is given in 6.5.2 and with respect to drilling and installation in 11.4.8(2).

### 6.5.2.2 Minimum cover for durability

(1) The minimum concrete covers $c_{\text {min,dur }}$ dependent on design service life, exposure class and exposure resistance class (ERC) are given in Table 6.3 (NDP) and Table 6.4 (NDP).

NOTE 1 The recommended minimum covers apply unless the National Annex gives other values.
NOTE 2 Additional and intermediate or a selection of exposure resistance classes can be applied according to the National Annex with correspondingly adjusted minimum cover for durability, provided they are based on the same methodology and give protection against deterioration consistent with that inherent in Table 6.3 (NDP) and Table 6.4 (NDP).

| XRC 7 | 15 | 30 | 25 | 40 | 40 | 60 | 45 | 60 |


NOTE 1 XRC classes for resistance against corrosion induced by carbonation are derived from the carbonation depth [mm] (characteristic value $90 \%$ fractile) assumed to be obtained after 50 years under reference conditions ( 400 ppm CO 2 in a constant $65 \%-R H$ environment and at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). The designation value of XRC has the dimension of a carbonation rate [ $\mathrm{mm} / \sqrt{ }$ (years)].
NOTE 2 The recommended minimum concrete cover values $c_{\text {min,dur }}$ assume execution and curing according to EN 13670 with at least execution class 2 and curing class 2.
NOTE 3 The minimum covers can be increased by an additional safety element $\Delta c_{\mathrm{dur}, \gamma}$ considering special requirements (e.g. more extreme environmental conditions).

| XRDS 10 | 50 | 65 | 80 | - | - | - | 50 | 65 | 80 | - | - | - |
| NOTE 1 XRDS classes for resistance against corrosion induced by chloride ingress are derived from the depth of chlorides penetration [mm] (characteristic value $90 \%$ fractile), corresponding to a reference chlorides concentration ( $0,6 \%$ by mass of binder (cement + type II additions)), assumed to be obtained after 50 years on a concrete exposed to one-sided penetration of reference seawater ( $30 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l} \mathrm{NaCl}$ ) at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The designation value of XRDS has the dimension of a diffusion coefficient $\left[10^{-13} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\right]$. <br> NOTE 2 The recommended minimum concrete cover values $c_{\text {min,dur }}$ assume execution and curing according to EN 13670 with at least execution class 2 and curing class 2. <br> NOTE 3 The minimum covers can be increased by an additional safety element $\Delta c_{\text {dur, } \gamma}$ considering special requirements (e. g. more extreme environmental conditions). |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |


(2) For temporary structures or for structures with a design service life of 30 years or less, $c_{\text {min,dur }}$ for a design service life of 50 years according to Table 6.3 (NDP) and Table 6.4 (NDP) may be reduced by $-\Delta c_{\min , 30}$.

NOTE The reduction of the cover is $-\Delta c_{\min , 30} \leq 5 \mathrm{~mm}$ unless the National Annex gives a different value.
(3) The values of $c_{\text {min,dur }}$ given in Table 6.3 (NDP) and Table 6.4 (NDP) may be reduced $-\Delta c_{\text {min,exc }}$ under the following execution conditions:
a) enhanced compaction of concrete can be ensured by geometrical characteristics, placement and curing (e.g. members with slab geometry with positions of reinforcement not affected by construction process);
b) or curing complies with at least curing Class 3 of EN 13670.

NOTE The reduction of the cover is $-\Delta c_{\min , \operatorname{exc}} \leq 5 \mathrm{~mm}$ unless the National Annex gives a different value.
(4) For prestressing tendons, pre- or post-tensioned, the cover values in Table 6.3 (NDP) and Table 6.4 (NDP) should be increased by $\Delta c_{\text {min,p }}$, except where the internal bonded post-tensioning systems are provided with protection level 2 or 3 according to 5.4.1, and internal unbonded prestressing tendons are encased in corrosion resistant sheaths.

NOTE The addition to the cover is $\Delta c_{\mathrm{min}, \mathrm{p}}=+10 \mathrm{~mm}$ unless the National Annex gives a different value.
(5) Where the concrete is provided with an additional protection (e.g. surface coating) the minimum cover values in Table 6.3 (NDP) and Table 6.4 (NDP) may be reduced by $\Delta c_{\text {dur,red1 }}$. The value to be used shall be established based on experience or testing in line with provisions valid in the project.

NOTE The reduction of the cover is $\Delta c_{\text {dur,red } 1} \leq 10 \mathrm{~mm}$ unless the National Annex gives a different value.
(6) For concrete abrasion according to XM classes according to Table 6.1, special attention should be given on the requirements to concrete mixes in EN 206. Optionally concrete abrasion may be allowed for by increasing the concrete cover (sacrificial layer) with $\Delta c_{\text {dur,abr }}$.
NOTE The following values of $\Delta c_{\text {dur,abr }}$ for sacrificial layer apply unless the National Annex gives different values:

- for XM1: $\Delta c_{\text {dur,abr }}=+5 \mathrm{~mm}$;
- for XM2: $\Delta c_{\text {dur,abr }}=+10 \mathrm{~mm}$;
- for XM3: $\Delta c_{\text {dur,abr }}=+15 \mathrm{~mm}$.
(7) For concrete surfaces subjected to abrasion from moving objects like vehicles and wheels and not protected by asphalt, or other protective layers, the selection of XM class and optional increase of concrete cover for abrasion should be considered based on an assessment taking account of factors such as annual daily traffic load, type of traffic, use of studded tyres as well as the concrete composition.
(8) Where insitu concrete is placed against other concrete elements (precast or insitu) the minimum concrete cover of the reinforcement for durability is not required provided that:
- the concrete strength is at least $f_{\mathrm{ck}} \geq 25 \mathrm{MPa}$;
- the interface is rough see 8.2.6(6).
(9) Where special measures according to 6.2(3) other than coating of the concrete surface are taken, the minimum cover may be reduced by $\Delta c_{\text {dur,red2 }}$. The value to be used shall be established based on experience or testing in line with provisions valid in the project.

NOTE The reduction of the cover $\Delta c_{\text {dur,red } 2}=0$ unless a National Annex gives a different value.

### 6.5.2.3 Minimum cover for bond

(1) In order to transmit bond forces safely and to ensure adequate compaction of the concrete, the minimum cover should not be less than $c_{\text {min,b }}$ given in Tables 6.5 and 6.6.

NOTE 1 The minimum concrete cover values $c_{\text {min, } \mathrm{b}}$ assume execution and curing according to EN 13670 with at least execution class 2 and curing class 2.

NOTE 2 For minimum concrete cover values $c_{\text {min,b }}$ of pre-tensioning tendons see 13.5.1(2), Table 13.1.
NOTE 3 For minimum concrete cover values $c_{\text {min,b }}$ of bonded post-installed reinforcing steel see 11.4.8, Table 11.2.

### 6.5.3 Allowance in design for deviation in cover

(1) To calculate the nominal cover $c_{\text {nom }}$, an addition to the minimum cover $c_{\text {min }}$ according to Formula (6.2) shall be made in design to allow for the deviation $\Delta c_{\mathrm{dev}}$ which shall be taken as the absolute value of the accepted negative deviation specified in the execution specification, e.g. given on the construction drawings (see EN 13670). Values for $\Delta c_{\mathrm{dev}}$ are given in Table 6.7 (NDP).

NOTE Cases and values of Table 6.7 (NDP) apply unless the National Annex gives different cases and values.

Table 6.7 (NDP) — Allowance for deviation $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{c}_{\mathrm{dev}}$
|  | Case | $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{c}_{\mathrm{dev}}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | In general: for execution in tolerance class 1 according to EN 13670 | 10 mm |
| 2 | For execution in tolerance class 2 according to EN 13670 | 5 mm |
| 3 | Where fabrication is subjected to a quality assurance system, in which the systematic monitoring includes measurements of the cover | 5 mm |
| 4 | Where it can be assured that an accurate measurement device is used for systematic monitoring and non conforming members are rejected (e.g. precast elements) | 0 mm |
| 5 | For concrete members in exposure class XC1, where the risk of corrosion is insignificant | 5 mm |
| 6 | For concrete cast against surfaces with exposed aggregate (e.g. interfaces) | 5 mm |
| 7 | For concrete cast against unevenness due to formwork or excavation sheeting (e.g. ribbed finishes or architectural textures) | 10 mm + dimension of unevenness |
| 8 | Concrete cast against prepared ground (including uneven blinding layer) ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ | $40 \mathrm{~mm}^{\mathrm{a}}$ |
| 9 | Concrete cast directly against unprepared soil ${ }^{\text {a }}$ | $75 \mathrm{~mm}^{\mathrm{a}}$ |
| 10 | Post-installed reinforcing bars | 5 mm or according to project specification |
| a These allowances for deviation $\Delta c_{\text {dev }}$ also apply for bored piles and for diaphragm walls designed according to this Eurocode, unless the National Annex gives other special values. |  |  |
