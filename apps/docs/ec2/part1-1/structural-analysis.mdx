title: 'Structural Analysis'
---

### 7.1 General

(1) The purpose of structural analysis is to establish the distribution of either internal forces, or stresses, strains and displacements, over the whole or part of a structure.
(2) Analyses shall be carried out using idealisations of both the structure and its geometry (see 7.2) and the behaviour of the structure (see 7.3). The idealisations selected shall be appropriate to the problem being considered.
(3) The effect of the geometry and properties of the structure on its behaviour at each stage of construction shall be considered in the design.
(4) Common idealisations in behaviour of the structure used for analysis are:

- linear elastic behaviour (see 7.3.1);
- linear elastic behaviour with redistribution (see 7.3.2);
- plastic behaviour (see 7.3.3), including strut-and-tie models and stress field models (see 7.3.3.3);
- non-linear behaviour (see 7.3.4).
(5) Imperfections and second order effects shall be considered where they are significant (see 7.4).
(6) Structural analysis shall be performed consistently with the design. A specific stiffness (e.g. torsional) or restraint at supports (e.g. moment) may be reduced or neglected in the analysis for both ultimate and serviceability limit states if the member is designed consistently with these assumptions and the minimum reinforcement provisions for crack control and robustness are fulfilled.
(7) Local analyses may be necessary where the assumption that plane sections remain plane (linear strain distribution) is not valid.

NOTE Examples of such cases are:

- in the vicinity of supports;
- in the vicinity of concentrated loads;
- in beam-column intersections;
- in anchorage zones;
- at changes in cross-section.


### 7.2 Structural modelling for analysis

### 7.2.1 Geometric imperfections

### 7.2.1.1 General

(1) The unfavourable effects of possible deviations in the geometry of the structure and the position of loads shall be considered in the analysis of members and structures.
(2) Deviations in cross-section dimensions which comply with tolerance class 1 of EN 13670 are considered in the partial factors for materials and generally may be neglected in structural analysis.
(3) Maximum deviations from theoretical geometry may be specified by the relevant authority or agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties. Where project specific execution specifications define stricter maximum deviations (e.g. when carrying out the assessment of an existing structure) as described in 7.2.1.2(1), the effect of imperfections should be based on these maximum deviations multiplied by 1,2 .
(4) For members with an axial force, other than internal prestressing, imperfections and their effects shall be considered in ultimate limit states to determine the first order effects where relevant.
(5) Imperfections may be neglected for serviceability limit states.

### 7.2.1.2 Representation of imperfections

(1) The following provisions apply for members and structures with an axial force and execution deviations according to EN 13670. If project-specific execution specifications for maximum deviations apply, these provisions should be modified in accordance with 7.2.1.1(3).
(2) Imperfections may be represented by an inclination $\theta_{\mathrm{i}}$ (see Figure 7.1), given by Formula (7.1):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\theta_{\mathrm{i}}=\alpha_{\mathrm{h}} \cdot \alpha_{\mathrm{m}} \cdot \frac{1}{200} \tag{7.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$\alpha_{\mathrm{h}} \quad$ is the reduction coefficient for length or height:

$$
\begin{equation*}
0,4 \leq \alpha_{\mathrm{h}}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{l}} \leq 1,0 ; \tag{7.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

$\alpha_{\mathrm{m}} \quad$ is the reduction coefficient for the number of members:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_{\mathrm{m}}=\sqrt{0,5\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)} ; \tag{7.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

$l$ is the length or height [m], see (3);
$m$ is the number of load bearing members in one section that bear a significant part of the vertical load and that, due to their inclination, contribute to the effect considered.
(3) In Formulae (7.2) and (7.3), the values of $l$ and $m$ should be taken as follows, depending on the effect considered:

- effect on individual member (see Figure 7.1 a )): $l=$ actual length of member, $m=1$;
- effect on bracing system (see Figure 7.1 b )): $l=$ height of the structure, $m=$ number of vertical members between two adjacent levels contributing to the horizontal force on the bracing system;
- effect on intermediate or end diaphragms distributing the horizontal loads (see Figure 7.1 c )): $l=$ storey height, $m=$ number of vertical braced elements between two adjacent levels contributing to the total horizontal force on the section.
(4) Alternatively (e.g. arches), the imperfection of the structural geometry may be determined from the governing buckling mode. Each mode shape may be idealized by a sinusoidal profile. The amplitude should be taken as

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{\mathrm{i}}=\theta_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot l_{\mathrm{aw}} / 2 \tag{7.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$l_{\text {aw }} \quad$ is half of the wavelength of the buckling mode with the lowest buckling load.
(5) For individual members, the effect of imperfections may be taken into account in two alternative ways:
a) For members in statically determinate structures, as an eccentricity $e_{\mathrm{i}}$ given by:

$$
\begin{equation*}
e_{\mathrm{i}}=\theta_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot \frac{l_{0}}{2} \tag{7.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $l_{0}$ is the effective length;
For walls and individual columns in braced systems, $e_{\mathrm{i}}=l_{0} / 400$ may always be used as a simplification, corresponding to $\alpha_{\mathrm{h}}=1,0$.
b) For members in both statically determinate and indeterminate structures as a fictitious transverse force $F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}$ in the position that gives maximum moment:

1) for unbraced members (see Figure 7.1 a1)):

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}=\theta_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot F_{\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{i}} \tag{7.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

2) for braced members (see Figure 7.1 a2)):

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}=2 \cdot \theta_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot F_{\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{i}} \tag{7.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $F_{V}$ is the vertical load.
For walls and individual columns in braced systems $\theta_{\mathrm{i}}=1 / 200$ may always be used as a simplification, corresponding to $\alpha_{\mathrm{h}}=1$.

The force $F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}$ may be substituted by some other equivalent transverse action. Since the force $F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}$ is fictitious, it should not be added to the forces transmitted by the individual member to other members of the structure.

Figure 7.1 - Examples of the effect of geometric imperfections

## Key

$l$ length of a member (length of structure in b))
(6) For structures not part of a bridge, the effect of the inclination $\theta_{\mathrm{i}}$ may be represented by the fictitious transverse forces, indicated in Formulae (7.8), (7.9) and (7.10), to be included in the analysis together with other actions. If the foundation is considered as a full diaphragm, equal and opposite forces should be applied at the level of foundations so that no reactions are transmitted to the foundations due to these fictitious forces.

Effect on bracing system (see Figure 7.1 b)):

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}=\theta_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot\left(N_{\mathrm{b}}-N_{\mathrm{a}}\right) \tag{7.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

The overall effect of geometrical imperfections may be addressed by designing the structure to take account of equivalent horizontal loads acting at the centroid of the individual intermediate diaphragms. In this case, the load is determined according to Formula (7.8) by replacing ( $N_{\mathrm{b}}-N_{\mathrm{a}}$ ) with the total vertical load acting on the actual intermediate diaphragm.
Effect on intermediate diaphragm (see Figure 7.1 c1)):

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}=\theta_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot\left(N_{\mathrm{b}}+N_{\mathrm{a}}\right) / 2 \tag{7.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

Effect on top diaphragm (see Figure 7.1 c2)):

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}=\theta_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{a}} \tag{7.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $N_{\mathrm{a}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{b}}$ are axial forces contributing to $F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i} \cdot}$
In the determination of the first order internal forces due to the combination of actions in the persistent and transient or the accidental design situation the horizontal forces $F_{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{i}}$ should be considered in the same load case as the corresponding axial force $N$.

### 7.2.2 Idealisation of the structure

(1) The structure should be idealized with suitable models considering static and geometrical boundary conditions as well as the transfer of support reactions.
(2) Significant asymmetry in geometry or loading should be considered either by a 3D-model or by adjusted planar models.
(3) Interaction of soil and structure should be considered appropriately and consistently with 4.2.1.4. Non-linear behaviour in the soil-structure interaction should be considered.
(4) Ribbed or waffle or void enclosing slabs may be treated as solid members for the purposes of analysis, provided that the flange or structural topping and transverse ribs have sufficient torsional stiffness. This may be assumed provided that:

- the rib spacing does not exceed 1500 mm ;
- the depth of the rib below the flange does not exceed 4 times its width, or the space between voids;
- transverse ribs are provided at a clear spacing not exceeding 10 times the overall depth of the slab. This applies also to the biggest horizontal void dimension; and
- the flange thickness is at least $1 / 10$ of the clear distance between ribs, the smallest horizontal void dimension or 50 mm , whichever is the greater. The minimum flange thickness of 50 mm may be reduced to 40 mm where permanent blocks are incorporated between the ribs.


### 7.2.3 Geometric data

(1) The effect of non-uniform stress distribution across wide flanges in T-beams should be considered at ULS where brittle behaviour may be expected and at SLS where relevant (stress limitations, deflections).
(2) In the absence of a more detailed analysis, the effective width of the flange may be calculated based on the distance $l_{0 \mathrm{~b}}$ between points of zero moment. The length $l_{0 \mathrm{~b}}$ may be obtained from Figure 7.2 if all of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- loading is predominantly uniform;
- the cross section is constant;
- the length of the cantilever, $l_{3}$, is less than half the adjacent span; and
- the ratio of adjacent spans lies between $2 / 3$ and 1,5 .

Figure 7.2 - Definition of $\boldsymbol{l}_{\mathbf{0 b}}$ for calculation of effective flange width

(3) In the absence of a more detailed analysis, the effective flange width $b_{\text {eff }}$ for a T beam or L beam may be derived as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
b_{\mathrm{eff}}=\sum b_{\mathrm{eff}, \mathrm{i}}+b_{\mathrm{w}} \leq b \tag{7.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
b_{\mathrm{eff}, \mathrm{i}}=\min \left\{0,2 b_{\mathrm{i}}+0,1 l_{0 \mathrm{~b}} ; 0,2 l_{0 \mathrm{~b}} ; b_{\mathrm{i}}\right\} \tag{7.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

(for the notations see Figures 7.2 and 7.3)

Figure 7.3 - Effective flange width parameters

(4) For structural analysis, where a great accuracy is not required, a constant width of the effective flange may be assumed over the whole span. In this case, the value applicable to the span section should be adopted.
(5) The span of a beam or slab should be the distance between centrelines of supporting members or bearings, in general. Reductions of this length may be permitted accounting for the support dimensions if the resulting eccentricities are accounted for in the design of supporting elements. Generally, the support reaction may be assumed to be distributed in a length equal to the minimum of the support width or the beam or slab height. For elastomeric bearings the stress should be assumed to be evenly distributed over the whole area of the support.
(6) Continuous beams and one-way slabs may be analysed assuming that the supports provide no rotational restraint.
(7) Where a supporting member is modelled as line or point support, the peak bending moment at the line or point support may be reduced based on the assumed distribution of the support reaction. For a uniformly distributed support reaction, the peak moment, may be reduced by an amount $\Delta M_{\text {Ed }}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta M_{\mathrm{Ed}}=\frac{F_{\mathrm{Ed}, \text { sup }} \cdot t}{8} \tag{7.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
F_{\text {Ed,sup }} & \text { is the design support reaction due to the loads applied on the beam or the slab; } \\
t & \text { is the length according to (5) over which the reaction is distributed }
\end{array}
$$

### 7.3 Methods of analysis

### 7.3.1 Linear elastic analysis

(1) Linear analysis of structures and members based on the theory of elasticity may be used for the calculation of internal forces in both serviceability and ultimate limit states.
(2) Except when specified otherwise as e.g. in (3), (4) and (5), and for structures designed for earthquake resistance, linear elastic analysis may be carried out for the determination of the action effects assuming:
a) uncracked cross-sections;
b) linear stress-strain relationships;
c) a mean value of the modulus of elasticity.
(3) A reduced stiffness may be considered in the analysis in member regions where cracking is expected under the relevant load combination. The assumed reduction of stiffness should be consistent with the amount of reinforcement provided in these regions. In case of continuous structures with prestressed and non-prestressed sections, the difference in stiffness between the prestressed and the non-prestressed areas should be considered in SLS.
(4) For the determination of the effect of imposed deformations at the serviceability limit state (SLS), cracking should be considered.
(5) When the effect of imposed deformations has to be considered at the ultimate limit state (ULS) (see 4.2.1.3(2)), a reduced stiffness due to cracking and creep and non-linear material behaviour may be assumed.
(6) Forces or stresses due to long-term differential settlements or shrinkage obtained by linear elastic analysis may be reduced to $E_{\mathrm{t}}$, to account for creep relaxation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{t}}=\frac{E_{t=0}}{1+\chi \varphi\left(t, t_{0}\right)} \tag{7.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$E_{\mathrm{t}} \quad$ is the internal force or stress at time $t$;
$E_{t=0} \quad$ is the internal force or stress at the end of construction with no consideration for creep;
$\chi \quad$ is the aging coefficient which may be taken equal to 0,8 for long term calculations;
$t \quad$ is the age of concrete when stresses are being evaluated;
$t_{0} \quad$ is the age of concrete when the settlement occurred or when curing ended, as appropriate.
(7) Creep redistribution of internal forces or stresses due to a change in the support conditions (i.e. due to construction procedure) may be accounted for by Formula (7.15):

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{t}}=E_{t=0}+\left(E_{\mathrm{wc}}-E_{t=0}\right) \frac{\varphi\left(t, t_{0}\right)-\varphi\left(t_{\mathrm{c}}, t_{0}\right)}{1+\chi \varphi\left(t, t_{\mathrm{c}}\right)} \tag{7.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

| $E_{\mathrm{t}}$ and $E_{t=0}$ see (6); |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| $E_{\text {wc }}$ | is the internal force or stress assuming the structure was built with the final support conditions; |
| $t_{0}$ | is the age of concrete when the loads producing the force or stress considered are applied; |
| $t_{\mathrm{c}}$ | is the age of concrete when support conditions change. |

### 7.3.2 Linear elastic analysis with redistribution

(1) Limited redistribution is allowed for braced slender structures. When redistribution of moments is applied its effects shall be considered on all aspects of design. The resulting distribution of internal forces and the reaction after redistribution shall remain in equilibrium with the applied loads.
(2) The amount of redistribution may be verified in two ways, without an explicit verification of the rotation capacity according (3) or with an explicit verification according (5).
(3) For members in which second order effects are negligible, linear analysis with limited redistribution without explicit check on the rotation capacity may be applied to the analysis of structural members for the verification of ULS provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:

- all members are predominantly subjected to flexure (second order effects are negligible);
- in case of continuous beams or slabs, the ratio of lengths of adjacent spans is in the range of 0,5 to 2,0;
- the ratio $\delta_{\mathrm{M}}$ of the moment after redistribution to the elastic bending moment complies with the value given by Formula (7.16):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\delta_{\mathrm{M}} \geq \frac{1}{1+0,7 \varepsilon_{\mathrm{cu}} \cdot E_{\mathrm{s}} / f_{\mathrm{yd}}}+\frac{x_{\mathrm{u}}}{d} \tag{7.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

$\geq 0,7$ where Class B or Class C reinforcing steel or prestressing steel is used (see Table 5.5); $\geq 0,8$ where Class A reinforcing steel is used (see Table 5.5).

In case of prestressed members, $f_{y d}$ in Formula (7.16) should be replaced by:

$$
\begin{equation*}
f=\frac{\left(f_{\mathrm{pd}}-\sigma_{\mathrm{pm}, \infty}\right) A_{\mathrm{p}}+f_{\mathrm{yd}} A_{\mathrm{s}}}{A_{\mathrm{p}}+A_{\mathrm{s}}} \tag{7.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$\sigma_{\mathrm{pm}, \infty}$ is the long-term stress level in prestressing tendons at the state of zero (elastic) strain of the concrete at the same level.

All values refer to the section of the redistributed moment.
(4) The arrangement of reinforcement in flat slabs should reflect the behaviour under service conditions, normally leading to a concentration of reinforcement over the columns. The requirements for maximum spacing of flexural reinforcement for solid slabs in 12.4.1 apply.
(5) Linear analysis with redistribution with an explicit check on the rotation capacity may be applied for the verification of ULS provided that the rotation demand $\theta_{\mathrm{Ed}}$ for the section with the plastic moment resistance is smaller than or equal to the rotation capacity $\theta_{\text {Rd }}$ of the section considered.

The design value of rotation demand follows from the integral of the curvatures after start of yielding in the section where cracking of concrete should be considered and the tensile strength and tension stiffening may be considered.

The rotation capacity may be derived from Formula (7.18).

$$
\begin{equation*}
\theta_{\mathrm{Rd}}=\frac{1,3 d}{\gamma_{\theta}}\left(\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)_{\mathrm{u}, \mathrm{~m}}-T S_{\mathrm{My}} \frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{yd}}}{d-x}\right) \tag{7.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left(\frac{1}{r}\right)_{\mathrm{u}, \mathrm{~m}}=T S_{\mathrm{Mu}} \cdot \min \left\{\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ud}}}{\left(d-x_{\mathrm{u}}\right)} ; \frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cu}, \mathrm{~d}, \rho_{\mathrm{w}}}}{x_{\mathrm{u}}}\right\}  \tag{7.19}\\
& \varepsilon_{\mathrm{cu}, \mathrm{~d}, \rho_{\mathrm{w}}}=0,002+\frac{1,35}{d}+3 \rho_{w} \leq 0,015  \tag{7.20}\\
& T S_{\mathrm{Mu}}=1-\frac{1}{2 \alpha} \cdot\left(1-\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{yd}}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ud}, \mathrm{ef}}}\right) \text { when } \alpha \geq 1  \tag{7.21}\\
& T S_{\mathrm{Mu}}=\frac{\alpha}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{yd}}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ud}, \mathrm{ef}}}\left(1-\frac{\alpha}{2}+\left(\frac{f_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{ef}}}{f_{\mathrm{yd}}}-1\right) \cdot\left(2-\frac{1}{\alpha}-\alpha\right)\right) \text { when } \alpha<1  \tag{7.22}\\
& T S_{\mathrm{My}}=1-0,6\left[\frac{M_{\mathrm{cr}}}{M_{\mathrm{y}}}\right] \geq 0,4  \tag{7.23}\\
& \alpha=\frac{\left(f_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{ef}}-f_{\mathrm{yd}}\right)}{0,6 f_{\mathrm{cm}}^{\frac{2}{3}}} \cdot \frac{\phi}{S_{\mathrm{r}, \mathrm{~m}, \mathrm{cal}}} \tag{7.24}
\end{align*}
$$

where

| $f_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{ef}}$ | is the tensile stress in the reinforcement when $M_{\mathrm{Rd}}$ is reached, assuming an inclined postelastic stress-strain-relation, see Figure 5.2; |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\varepsilon_{\text {ud,ef }}$ | is the strain in the reinforcement with a stress equal to $f_{\text {s,ef }}$; |
| $M_{y}$ | is the internal moment when the strain in the tension reinforcement equals $\varepsilon_{y d}$; |
| $\varepsilon_{y d}$ | $=f_{\mathrm{yd}} / E_{\mathrm{s}}$ |
| $\gamma_{\theta}$ | is a partial factor for model uncertainty. |

NOTE The value of $\gamma_{\theta}=3,0$ applies unless the National Annex gives a different value.

### 7.3.3 Plastic analysis

### 7.3.3.1 General

(1) Methods based on plastic analysis may be used for the check at ULS only, except for analyses with stress fields and strut-and-tie models (see 7.3.3.3) which may also be used in SLS in certain conditions (see 9.2.3(8)).
(2) Plastic analysis should in general be based on the lower bound theorem of limit analysis. Plastic methods based on the upper bound theorem of limit analysis may be used, if it is known by experience that the type of assumed mechanisms can develop.
(3) The plastic deformation capacity of the critical sections shall be sufficient for the envisaged mechanism to be formed.
(4) The effects of previous applications of loading may be ignored, and a monotonic increase of the intensity of actions may be assumed.
(5) Plastic analysis shall only be used for regions in which, within the plastic hinge, reinforcing steel is of Class B or C. Prestressing steel may be considered as Class B steel.
(6) For plastic analysis, the horizontal branch of the stress-strain diagram for the reinforcement (see Figures 5.2 and 5.3) shall be used when determining the sectional capacity of the cross-sections.

### 7.3.3.2 Analysis for beams, frames and slabs without verification of rotation capacity

(1) Plastic analysis without any direct check of rotation capacity may be used for the ultimate limit state if all the following conditions are fulfilled:
a) the area of tensile reinforcement is limited such that, at any section where plastic hinges are expected to occur $x_{\mathrm{u}} / d \leq 0,25$;
b) the ratio of the moments at intermediate supports to the moments in the span is between 0,5 and 2,0 .

### 7.3.3.3 Analysis with stress fields and strut-and-tie models

(1) Stress fields and strut-and-tie models may be used to determine the action effects in structures and members. This includes deep beams, walls and zones of discontinuities.
(2) Internal forces in struts and ties may be calculated based on linear elastic analysis, non-linear analysis or plastic analysis.

### 7.3.4 Non-linear analysis

(1) Where non-linear methods of analysis are used for verification of ULS or SLS, equilibrium and compatibility shall be satisfied and realistic non-linear behaviour of materials should be considered.
(2) The general rules for non-linear analysis procedures given in EN 1990 shall be respected.

If non-linear methods of analysis are used for verification of ULS by numerical simulations, the results shall be confirmed by means of a comparison with simplified analytical methods. In case of significant differences with analysis according to Clause 8, the discrepancies should be justified.

NOTE For the verification of the ultimate limit states the specific provisions given in Annex F can be followed.
(3) The constitutive material models for concrete, reinforcement and their interaction should capture all relevant features of material behaviour for the specific problem to be considered. Time-dependent material properties of concrete (such as shrinkage and creep), should be considered if necessary.
(4) Non-linear material models and numerical procedures should be validated for each field of application by tests, analytical solutions and/or benchmark test results, including basic tests on materials, structural reference tests and mesh sensitivity studies.
(5) If material characteristics, such as tensile strength or fracture energy of concrete, have an important influence on the results, a sensitivity analysis of the structural behaviour with respect to such characteristics should be performed.
(6) When analysis and verification are combined, the resistance against bending and axial forces, as well as the resistance of planar elements against membrane forces and/or bending and twisting moments, shall not depend on the tensile strength of concrete.
(7) A proper description of multi-axial states of stress in concrete should be considered, particularly when tension and compression are combined in the same finite element response.
(8) Modelling of cracking should consider the direction of the reinforcement able to control the crack opening.

### 7.4 Second order structural analysis of members and systems with axial force

### 7.4.1 General

(1) The provisions of 7.4 should be applied to members or structures (e.g. those with a flexible bracing system) in which the structural behaviour is significantly influenced by second order effects.

NOTE Annex O provides complementary guidance to simplified methods for second order structural analysis of members and structures.
(2) Where second order effects are considered, equilibrium and resistance shall be verified in the deformed state. Deformations shall be calculated considering the relevant effects of cracking, non-linear material properties and creep.
(3) Second order effects may be ignored if they are not more than $10 \%$ of the corresponding first order effects.

For global second order effects this condition may be considered satisfied if Formula (7.25) is satisfied:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{F_{\mathrm{VB}}}{F_{\mathrm{VEd}}} \geq 10 \tag{7.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$F_{\text {VEd }} \quad$ is the total design vertical load on the bracing structure and the members braced by it;
$F_{\mathrm{VB}} \quad$ is the buckling load of the bracing structure determined from a set of forces proportional to $F_{\text {ved. }}$

NOTE $\quad F_{\mathrm{vb}}$ can be determined according to Formula (0.1). For local second order effects (isolated members), simplified criteria are given in 0.4 .
(4) The design moment for ultimate limit state verification shall be the larger of the first order moment and the total design moment including second order effects.
(5) Where relevant, analysis shall include the effect of flexibility of adjacent members and foundations (soil-structure interaction).
(6) The structural behaviour shall be considered in the direction in which deformations can occur, and biaxial bending shall be considered when necessary.

### 7.4.2 Creep

(1) The effect of creep should be considered in second order analysis, with due regard to both the general conditions for creep (see 5.1.5 and B.5) and the duration of different loads in the load combination considered.
(2) The duration of loads may be considered in a simplified way by means of an effective creep coefficient, which, used together with the design load, gives a creep deformation corresponding to the quasi-permanent load. For global second order effects, $\varphi_{\text {eff,s }}$ may be taken from Formula (7.26). For isolated members and local second order effects, $\varphi_{\text {eff, } b}$ may be taken from Formula (7.27).

$$
\begin{align*}
& \varphi_{\mathrm{eff}, \mathrm{~s}}=\varphi\left(t_{\mathrm{DL}}, t_{0}\right) \frac{\delta_{0 \mathrm{Eqp}}}{\delta_{\mathrm{Ed}}}  \tag{7.26}\\
& \varphi_{\mathrm{eff}, \mathrm{~b}}=\varphi\left(t_{\mathrm{DL}}, t_{0}\right) \frac{M_{0 \mathrm{Eqp}}}{M_{0 \mathrm{Ed}}} \tag{7.27}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\varphi\left(t_{\mathrm{DL}}, t_{0}\right) & \text { is the creep coefficient at design service life according to Table } 5.2 \text { or B.5, where relevant } \\
& \text { the average of the creep coefficients of the members considered may be used; } \\
\delta_{0 \text { Eqp }} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { is the maximum short-term horizontal deflection due to the quasi permanent load } \\
\text { combination determined assuming uncracked cross-sections; }
\end{array} \\
\delta_{\text {Ed }} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { is the maximum short-term horizontal deflection due to the relevant load combinations } \\
\text { from a first order analysis determined assuming uncracked cross-sections. At least two } \\
\text { combinations should be considered: the one corresponding to the combination with } \\
\text { dominant horizontal load and the one corresponding to the combination with dominant } \\
\text { vertical imposed load, the largest resulting value of } \varphi_{\text {eff, } \mathrm{b}} \text { should be used; }
\end{array} \\
M_{0 \text { Eqp }} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { is the maximum first order moment due to the quasi-permanent load combination including } \\
\text { the effect of the imperfections as described in } 7.2 .1 ;
\end{array} \\
M_{0 \text { Ed }} & \text { is the maximum first order moment due to the relevant load combination. }
\end{array}
$$

(3) As an approximation the ratio between the moments ( $M_{\text {0Eqp }} / M_{\text {0Ed }}$ ) in Formula (7.27) may be replaced by the ratio of vertical loads in the quasi permanent and design situations.
(4) Where global and local analysis are combined, $\varphi_{\text {eff }}$ should be taken as the maximum of $\varphi_{\text {eff, } \mathrm{s}}$ and $\varphi_{\text {eff, } \mathrm{b}}$ unless it is demonstrated that local second order effects are not governing, in which case $\varphi_{\text {eff }}=\varphi_{\text {eff,s }}$.

### 7.4.3 Methods of analysis

### 7.4.3.1 General

(1) Either one of the following three methods of analysis may be used:

- a simplified method based on nominal curvature, which only accounts for local second order effects (see 7.4.3.2);
- a second order linear elastic analysis method based either on a reduced stiffness value (see 7.4.3.2), or on a moment magnification factor; and
- a general, fully non-linear analysis method (see 7.4.3.3).

NOTE An example of a method based on:

- nominal curvature is given in 0.7;
- a reduced stiffness value is given in 0.8.1;
- a moment magnification factor is given in 0.8.2.


### 7.4.3.2 Simplified methods based on nominal curvature and second order linear analysis

(1) The methods based on the nominal curvature and on second order linear elastic analysis should use an effective stiffness. This stiffness may conservatively be taken as the stiffness corresponding to the situation where yielding occurs (see Figure 7.4 a)). For global effects, when yielding of the reinforcement occurs successively at different locations, the stiffness corresponding to the situation for which the last plastic hinge develops may be conservatively used (see Figure 7.4 b)). Other less conservative estimates may also be used where justified.

### 7.4.3.3 General non-linear analysis method

(1) For the general method based on full non-linear analysis, including geometric non-linearity i.e. second order effects, the general rules for non-linear analysis given in 7.3.4 shall apply.
(2) Stress-strain curves for concrete and reinforcement suitable for overall analysis shall be used. The effect of creep shall be considered.
(3) Stress-strain relationships given in 5.1.6, (Formula (5.6)) for concrete and in 5.2.4 (Figure 5.2) for reinforcing steel and in 5.3.3 (Figure 5.3) for prestressing steel may be used. With stress-strain diagrams based on design values, a design value of the ultimate load is obtained directly from analysis.

When Formula (5.6) is used to determine the stress-strain relationships for concrete, $f_{\mathrm{cm}}$ shall be substituted by the design compressive strength $f_{\mathrm{cd}}$ (except in Formula (5.9) for $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{c} 1}$ ) and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cu} 1}$ shall be substituted by 0,0035 and $E_{\mathrm{cm}}$ shall be substituted by $E_{\mathrm{cd}}$ given in Formula (7.28):

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{cd}}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{cm}}}{\gamma_{\mathrm{CE}}} \tag{7.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

NOTE Where alternative stress-strain relationships for concrete are used, the nature of the analysis to be used and the phenomenon included need to be considered.
(4) In the absence of more refined models, creep may be taken into account by multiplying all strain values in the concrete stress-strain diagram according to 7.4.3.3(3) with a factor ( $1+\varphi_{\text {eff }}$ ), where $\varphi_{\text {eff }}$ is the effective creep ratio according to 7.4.2(4).
(5) The favourable effect of tension stiffening may be considered in the determination of the stiffness provided that 7.3.4(6) is fulfilled.
(6) Normally, conditions of equilibrium and strain compatibility should be satisfied in a number of cross-sections. As a simplification, this condition may be imposed only at the critical cross-section(s), assuming a relevant variation of the curvature in between, e.g. similar to the first order moment or simplified in another appropriate way.

### 7.4.4 Compression member with biaxial bending

(1) The general method in 7.4.3.3 may be used for biaxial bending. If simplified methods are used, provisions (3) and (4) apply.
(2) The cross-section of the member with the critical combination of moments should be used for verifications.
(3) Separate design in each principal direction taking into account second order effects, disregarding biaxial bending interaction, may be used as a first step. Imperfections should be considered only in the direction where they will have the most unfavourable effect.
(4) Further checks may be omitted if the slenderness ratio satisfies the following condition:

$$
\begin{equation*}
0,5 \leq \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{y}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{z}}} \leq 2 \tag{7.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

and if the ratio of the dimensionless eccentricities $e_{\mathrm{y}}^{\prime}$ and $e_{\mathrm{z}}^{\prime}$ (see Figure 7.5) satisfy one of the following conditions:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{e_{\mathrm{y}}^{\prime}}{e_{\mathrm{z}}^{\prime}} \leq 0,2 \text { or } \frac{e_{\mathrm{y}}^{\prime}}{e_{\mathrm{z}}^{\prime}} \geq 5 \tag{7.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
e_{\mathrm{z}}^{\prime}=M_{\mathrm{Edy}} /\left|N_{\mathrm{Ed}} \cdot b\right| & \text { is the dimensionless eccentricity along the } z \text {-axis; } \\
e_{\mathrm{y}}^{\prime}=M_{\mathrm{Edz}} /\left|N_{\mathrm{Ed}} \cdot h\right| & \text { is the dimensionless eccentricity along the } y \text {-axis. }
\end{array}
$$

For non-rectangular sections, $b$ and $h$ shall be replaced by $b_{\mathrm{eq}}=i_{\mathrm{y}} \sqrt{12}$ and $h_{\mathrm{eq}}=i_{\mathrm{z}} \sqrt{12}$.
(5) Unless all of the conditions of Formulae (7.29) and (7.30) are fulfilled, biaxial bending as described in 8.1.1(8) should be taken into account including second order effects in each direction.

Figure 7.5 - Definition of eccentricities $e_{\mathrm{y}}$ and $e_{\mathrm{z}}$

### 7.5 Lateral instability of slender beams

(1) Lateral instability of slender beams shall be considered where necessary, e.g. for precast beams during transport and erection, for beams without sufficient lateral bracing in the finished structure, etc. Geometric imperfections shall be considered in the calculation of effects due to lateral instability.
(2) In absence of project-specific execution specifications which define maximum deviations, a lateral deflection of $l / 300$ should be assumed as a geometric imperfection in the verification of beams in unbraced conditions, with $l=$ total length of beam. In finished structures, bracing from connected members may be considered.
(3) Second order effects in connection with lateral instability may be ignored if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- persistent design situations:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{l_{0 \mathrm{t}}}{b} \leq \frac{50}{(h / b)^{1 / 3}} \tag{7.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

- transient design situations:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{l_{0 \mathrm{t}}}{b} \leq \frac{70}{(h / b)^{1 / 3}} \tag{7.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$l_{0 \mathrm{t}} \quad$ is the distance between torsional restraints;
$h \quad$ is the total depth of the beam in central part of $l_{0 t}$;
$b \quad$ is the width of the compression flange.
(4) Torsion associated with lateral instability should be considered in the design of members supporting slender beams.

### 7.6 Prestressed members and structures

### 7.6.1 General

(1) The effects of prestressing may be considered by one of the following equivalent approaches:
a) self-equilibrated state of stresses in the concrete and the tendons (approach also known as prestressing considered on the side of resistance). In this case, the internal forces due prestressing are due only to external restraints (statically indeterminate component of prestressing);

NOTE In this case the effect of prestressing can be modelled by imposing on the sections of the structure an axial strain equal to the prestressing force divided by the axial stiffness of the section and a curvature equal to the prestressing force times the eccentricity of prestressing with respect to the centroid divided by the flexural stiffness of the section.
b) set of self-equilibrated system of forces (anchorage, deviation and friction forces) exerted by the tendons on the concrete member (approach also known as prestressing considered as external action). In this case, the internal forces include both the statically determined and the statically indeterminate components of prestressing.
(2) Since the internal forces resulting from the two approaches are different, the resistance of sections and members shall be verified consistently, according to 7.6.5(1).

### 7.6.2 Prestressing force

(1) At a given time $t$ and distance $x$ (or arc length) from the active end of the tendon the mean prestress stress $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{m}}(x, t)$ should be taken equal to the maximum stress $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \text { max }}$ imposed at the active end, minus the immediate losses (see 7.6.3) and the time dependent losses (see 7.6.4), using absolute values for all losses.
(2) Short-term prestressing stresses should be limited to the values given in Table 7.1 or agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties.

Table 7.1 - Limits to short-term prestressing stresses
| Stress being limited | Stress limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Maximum stressing stress $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \text { max }}$ | $\leq 0,8 f_{\mathrm{pk}}$ |
|  | $\leq 0,9 f_{\mathrm{p} 0,1 \mathrm{k}}$ |
| Overstressing (e.g. for the occurrence of unexpectedly high friction) | $\leq 0,95 f_{\mathrm{p} 0,1 \mathrm{k}}$ |
| Maximum stress after prestress transfer/anchoring ${ }^{\mathrm{b}} \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{m}}(x, 0)$ | $\leq 0,75 f_{\mathrm{pk}}$ |
|  | $\leq 0,85 f_{\mathrm{p} 0,1 \mathrm{k}}$ |
| a Overstressing is permitted only if the force in the jack can be measured to an accuracy of $\pm 5 \%$ of the final value of the prestressing force. <br> b The stress after transfer/anchoring is determined by subtracting the immediate losses (see 7.6.3) from the stress imposed at the active end. |  |


(3) The mean value of the prestress stress $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{m}}(x, t)$ at the time $t>t_{0}$ should be determined taking into account the prestressing method. In addition to the immediate losses $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{i}}$ given in 7.6.3 time-dependent losses of prestress $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{c}+\mathrm{s}+\mathrm{r}}(x)$ given in 7.6.4 as a result of creep and shrinkage of the concrete and longterm relaxation of the prestressing steel should be considered:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{~m}}(x, t)=\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{~m}}\left(x, t_{0}\right)-\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{c}+\mathrm{s}+\mathrm{r}}(x, t) \tag{7.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 7.6.3 Immediate losses of prestress

### 7.6.3.1 General

(1) When determining the immediate losses $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{i}}(x)$ the following influences should be considered for pre-tensioning and post-tensioning where relevant:

- during the stressing process: losses due to friction between the prestressing steel and duct or deviation devices $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mu}(\mathrm{x})$, see 7.6.3.2;
- during the stressing process: losses due to anchorage seating (e.g. wedge draw-in), see 7.6.3.3;
- at the transfer of prestress to concrete: losses due to instantaneous deformation of concrete, see 7.6.3.4;
- losses due to short-term relaxation of the pretensioning tendons during the period which elapses between the tensioning of the tendons and prestressing of the concrete $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{pr}}$ (where relevant), see B.9. In case of heat curing, losses due to shrinkage and relaxation are modified and should be assessed accordingly; direct thermal effect should also be considered (see 13.4.2).


### 7.6.3.2 Losses due to friction

(1) The losses due to friction $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mu}(x)$ in prestressing tendons should be estimated from:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mu}(x)=\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \max }\left[1-\exp \left(-\mu\left(\alpha_{\mu}+k_{\mu} x\right)\right)\right] \tag{7.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$\alpha_{\mu} \quad$ is the sum of the absolute values of angular deviations in radians over a distance $x$;
$\mu \quad$ is the coefficient of friction between the tendon and its duct or deviation device;
$k_{\mu} \quad$ is an unintentional angular deviation for internal post-tensioning tendons in grouted ducts and greased strands in radian per unit length- (curvature); and
$x \quad$ is the distance along the tendon from the point where the prestressing stress is equal to $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \max }^{-}$ (the force at the active end during tensioning).

NOTE 1 The values $\mu$ and $k_{\mu}$ can be found in the technical documentation of post-tensioning system.
NOTE 2 The value $\mu$ depends on the surface characteristics of the tendons and the duct or deviation device, on the presence of rust, on the elongation of the tendon and on the tendon profile.

NOTE 3 The value $k_{\mu}$ for unintentional angular deviation depends on the quality of workmanship, on the distance between tendon supports, on the type of duct or sheath employed, and on the degree of vibration used in placing the concrete.
(2) In the absence of more precise data, the values for $\mu$ given in Table 7.2 may be used, in Formula (7.34).
(3) In the absence of more precise data, values for unintentional angular deviation for internal posttensioning tendons will generally be in the range $0,005<k_{\mu}<0,01$ per metre. For pre-tensioning tendons and external tendons, the losses of prestress due to unintentional angular displacement may be ignored.

Table 7.2 - Coefficients of friction $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ of internal post-tensioning tendons and external tendons to be used in the absence of more precise data
| Type of prestressing steel | Internal tendons |  | Greased and sheathed strand | External tendons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | metal duct | polymer duct | PE duct | PE duct |
| Cold drawn wire | 0,17 | 0,12 | - | 0,10 |
| Strand | 0,19 | 0,14 | 0,05 | 0,12 |
| Deformed bar | 0,65 | - | - | - |
| Smooth round bar | 0,33 | - | - | - |


### 7.6.3.3 Losses due to anchorage seating

(1) Account should be taken of the losses due to anchorage seating, during the operation of anchoring the prestressing steel after tensioning.

NOTE Values for anchorage seating are given in the technical documentation of post-tensioning system.

### 7.6.3.4 Losses due to the instantaneous deformation of concrete

(1) Where relevant, account should be taken of the loss in tendon stress corresponding to the deformation of concrete, considering the tensioning programme in which the tendons are stressed.

### 7.6.4 Time dependent losses of prestress

(1) The time dependent losses should be calculated by considering the following two reductions of stress:
a) That due to the reduction of strain, caused by the deformation of concrete due to creep and shrinkage, under the quasi-permanent loads; and
b) that due to the reduction of stress in the steel due to the relaxation under tension (see B.9).

The interaction between the relaxation of prestressing steel and the concrete deformation due to creep and shrinkage may generally and approximately be considered by applying a reduction factor of 0,8 on the stress relaxation. More refined methods may be used for the calculation of relaxation losses, taking into account the variation of the tendon elongation due to creep and shrinkage of concrete.
(2) Time dependent losses of stress in the tendons due to creep, shrinkage and relaxation at location $x$, at time $t$ under the quasi-permanent combination of actions may be evaluated by Formula (7.35).

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{c}+\mathrm{s}+\mathrm{r}}=\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cs}} E_{\mathrm{p}}+0,8 \Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{pr}}+\frac{E_{\mathrm{p}}}{E_{\mathrm{cm}}} \varphi\left(t, t_{0}\right) \sigma_{\mathrm{cp}, \mathrm{QP}}}{1+\frac{E_{\mathrm{p}}}{E_{\mathrm{cm}}} \frac{A_{\mathrm{p}}}{A_{\mathrm{c}}}\left(1+\frac{A_{\mathrm{c}}}{I_{\mathrm{c}}} Z_{\mathrm{cp}}^{2}\right)\left[1+0,8 \varphi\left(t, t_{0}\right)\right]} \tag{7.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{pr}} \quad$ is the absolute value of the variation of stress in the tendons at location $x$, at time $t$, due to the relaxation of the prestressing steel. It should be determined for the initial stress in the tendons due to initial prestress and quasi-permanent combination of actions $\sigma_{\mathrm{pr}}=\sigma_{\mathrm{pr}}\left(G+P_{\mathrm{m} 0}+\psi_{2} Q\right) ;$
$\sigma_{\mathrm{cp}, \mathrm{QP}} \quad$ is the stress in the concrete adjacent to the tendons, due to self-weight and initial prestress and other quasi-permanent actions where relevant. The value of $\sigma_{\mathrm{cp}, \mathrm{Q} P}$ can be the effect of part of self-weight and initial prestress or the effect of a full quasi-permanent combination of actions $\left[\sigma_{\mathrm{cp}} \cdot\left(G+P_{\mathrm{m} 0}+\psi_{2} Q\right)\right]$, depending on the stage of construction considered (see B.4);
$Z_{\mathrm{cp}} \quad$ is the distance between the centroid of the concrete section and the tendons.
NOTE 1 It is conservative to adopt a value of 1,0 for the denominator of Formula (7.35).
NOTE 2 Unless specified for the project, it is not necessary to consider time dependent losses beyond the design service life of the structure.
(3) Formula (7.35) applies to bonded tendons when local values of stresses are used and to unbonded tendons when mean values of stresses are used. The mean values should be calculated between straight sections limited by the deviation points for external tendons or along the entire length in case of internal tendons.

### 7.6.5 Effects of prestressing at ultimate limit state

(1) The statically determinated component of prestressing may be considered either as an external action or as a resistance when verifying the ultimate limit state for flexural resistance (see 7.6.1(1)). In the first case, when determining the flexural capacity of the section, the resistance of the tendon shall be limited to $f_{\mathrm{pd}}-\sigma_{\mathrm{pd}}$. In the second case it shall be limited to $f_{\mathrm{pd}}$.
(2) In general, the design value of the prestressing stress as external action may be determined as $\sigma_{\mathrm{pd}}(x, t)=\gamma_{\mathrm{P}} \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{m}}(x, t)$.
(3) For prestressed members with unbonded tendons, the deformation of the whole member should generally be taken into account, when calculating the increase of the stress in the prestressing steel. If no detailed calculation is made and if the distance between fixed points does not exceed one span, it may be assumed that the increase of the stress at ultimate limit state due to the deformation of the member before reaching failure is $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}, \text { ULS }}=100 \mathrm{MPa}$.
(4) If the stress increase in unbonded tendons is calculated for prestressed members using the deformation state of the whole member the mean values of the material properties should be used. The design value of the stress increase $\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{pd}}=\Delta \sigma_{\mathrm{p}} \cdot \gamma_{\Delta \mathrm{P}}$ should be determined by applying partial safety factors $\gamma_{\Delta \mathrm{P}, \text { sup }}$ or $\gamma_{\Delta \mathrm{P}, \text { inf }}$, according to 4.3.2.
(5) For external prestressing tendons, the strain in the prestressing steel between two subsequent fixed points may be assumed to be constant. The strain in the prestressing steel should then be taken as equal to the initial strain, determined just after completion of the prestressing operation of each tendon, increased by the strain resulting from the structural deformation between the contact points considered, considering time-dependent losses. A deviator in an external tendon may be considered as a fixed point if the difference of tendon force between the two ends of the deviation point is smaller than the friction loss of the tendon in the deviation point.
