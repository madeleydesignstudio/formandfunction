### 3.10 Sign conventions

(1) In general, forces, stresses and strains which result in an elongation of material have a positive and those which result in shortening have a negative sign. When compressive or tensile forces are indicated in a figure by a vector they have a positive sign when they are acting in the direction described by the vector.
(2) All tensile and compressive material strengths are used with a positive sign.
(3) Shortening due to shrinkage is considered positive.
