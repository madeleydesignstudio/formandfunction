# Tables for mean values of specific weight of construction materials, and mean values of specific weight and angles of repose for stored materials

## A.1 Use of this Annex

(1) This Informative Annex provides supplementary guidance to that given in Clause 4 for mean values of specific weight of construction materials, and mean values of specific weight and angles of repose for stored materials.

**NOTE** National choice on the application of this Informative Annex is given in the National Annex. If the National Annex contains no information on the application of this Informative Annex, it can be used.

## A.2 Scope and field of application

(1) This Informative Annex applies to construction and stored materials, including bridge materials.

## A.3 Construction materials

(1) Mean values for the following construction materials provided in Tables A.1 to A.6 should be used:

- concrete and mortar;
- masonry;
- wood;
- metals;
- other materials;
- bridge materials and elements.

**NOTE** The values for the specific weight are for materials in the dry state.

(2) When a range is given, the selection of the appropriate mean values for specific weight and angles of repose should be as specified by the relevant authority or, where not specified, as agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties.

**NOTE** When a range is given, it is assumed that the mean value will be highly dependent on the source of the material.
