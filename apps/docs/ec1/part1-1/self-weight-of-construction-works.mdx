### 5.1 Design situations

(1) The self-weight of the structure or structural member shall be determined for each relevant design situation.

NOTE For the selection of design situations, see EN 1990:2023, 5.2.
(2) Where elements other than structural are classified as permanent actions, the total self-weight (including both structural members and elements other than structural) should be treated as a single action when introducing relevant combinations of actions according to the single source principle.

NOTE 1 For the classification of self-weight of elements other than structural, see 5.2(2).
NOTE 2 For the single source principle, see EN 1990:2023, 6.1.1.
(3) For areas where it is intended to remove, add or modify structural members or elements other than structural, the load-effect of the intended removal, modification or addition shall be incorporated in the load cases where applicable.

NOTE See EN 1991-1-6 for removals, modifications or additions during execution.
(4) When a water action is classified as permanent, the water level shall be taken into account for the relevant design situations.

NOTE See EN 1990 for classification of water actions and EN 1997 (all parts) for additional information about treatment of groundwater.
(5) The moisture content of bulk materials should be considered where appropriate in design situations, e.g. for buildings used for storage purposes.
(6) Variations in moisture content and variation in thickness during the design service life of the structure should be considered when dealing with loads due to ballast and earth loads, see Clause 4(4).

NOTE For detailed information on earth pressures, see EN 1997-3.

### 5.2 Classification

(1) The self-weight of structural members shall be classified as a permanent fixed action.

NOTE For the classification of actions, see EN 1990:2023, 6.1.1.
(2) The self-weight of elements other than structural should be classified as a permanent action, either fixed or free as relevant.

NOTE Elements other than structural are typically classified as permanent actions, but there can be cases where it is relevant to classify them as variable actions, see 6.5.3.1 for a simplified approach for the treatment of partitions as imposed loads.

### 5.3 Representation of actions

(1) The self-weight of the construction works should in most cases be represented by a single characteristic value.

NOTE EN 1990:2023, 6.1.2.2 clarifies when a permanent action can be represented by a single characteristic value.
(2) According to EN 1990:2023, 6.1.2.2, if the uncertainty in the self-weight is not small, or if the structure is sensitive to variations in its value or spatial distribution, the self-weight should be represented by upper and lower characteristic values $G_{\mathrm{k}, \text { sup }}$ and $G_{\mathrm{k}, \text { inf }}$ respectively.

NOTE See 5.4.3 for cases where upper and lower characteristic values are to be used for bridges.

### 5.4 Characteristic values of self-weight

### 5.4.1 General

(1) The determination of the characteristic values of self-weight shall be in accordance with EN 1990:2023, 6.1.2.2.
(2) If the self-weight of the structure or structural member is represented by a single characteristic value (see 5.3(1)), it may be calculated from the product of the nominal dimensions of the structure or structural member and the characteristic values of the specific weights.

NOTE Nominal dimensions are typically those specified in the design.

### 5.4.2 Additional provisions for buildings

(1) For manufactured elements such as flooring systems, facades and ceilings, lifts and equipment for buildings, data provided by the manufacturer on relevant characteristic values should be used when available.

### 5.4.3 Additional provisions for bridges

(1) The upper and lower characteristic values of specific weights for elements other than structural, such as ballast on railway bridges, or fill above buried structures such as culverts, should be taken into account if the material is expected to consolidate, become saturated or otherwise change its properties, during the design service life.

NOTE Upper and lower characteristic values of specific weights for elements other than structural specific to bridges can be given in the National Annex.
(2) The nominal depth of ballast on railway bridges and the deviation from the nominal depth used to determine the upper and lower characteristic values of the depth of ballast should be specified where relevant.

NOTE 1 A suitable value of the depth of ballast on railway bridges can be given in the National Annex.
NOTE 2 The deviation from the nominal depth is $\pm 30 \%$ unless the National Annex gives a different value.
(3) To determine the upper and lower characteristic values of self-weight of waterproofing, surfacing and other coatings for bridges, where the variability of their thickness can be high, a deviation of the total thickness from the nominal or other specified values should be taken into account.

NOTE The deviation of the total thickness from the nominal or other specified values is equal to $\pm 20 \%$ if a post-execution coating is included in the nominal value, and to $+40 \%$ and $-20 \%$ if such a coating is not included, unless the National Annex gives a different value.
(4) To determine the upper and lower characteristic values of the self-weight of cables, pipes and service ducts, a deviation from the mean value of the self-weight should be taken into account.

NOTE The deviation from the mean value of the self-weight is $\pm 20 \%$, unless the National Annex gives a different value.
(5) For elements such as

- hand rails, safety barriers, parapets, kerbs and other bridge furniture;
- joints/fasteners;
- void formers.
the characteristic values of the self-weight should be specified where relevant.
NOTE The characteristic value for the self-weight of such elements is the nominal value unless the National Annex gives different rules.
(6) The filling of voids with water or other materials should be considered as relevant.
