# Imposed Loads on Buildings

## 6.1 Design situations

### General Requirements

The imposed loads shall be determined for each relevant design situation.

<Note>
  For the selection of design situations see EN 1990:2023, 5.2
</Note>

For areas which can be subjected to different categories of imposed loads (i.e. multiple use), the category of loading which produces the most adverse effects of actions (e.g. forces or deflection) in the structural member under consideration shall be considered.

In design situations when different imposed loads act simultaneously with other variable actions (e.g. actions induced by wind, snow, cranes or machinery), the imposed loads considered in the load case should be treated as a single action (leading or accompanying).

### Fatigue and Dynamic Considerations

Where the number of load variations or the effects of vibrations can cause fatigue, a fatigue load model should be established.

For structures susceptible to vibrations, dynamic models of imposed loads should be considered where relevant.

<Note>
  - For dynamic actions, see EN 1990 and the additional provisions given in 6.2.2
  - For dynamic loads caused by machinery, see EN 1991-3
</Note>

The imposed loads to be considered for serviceability limit state verifications should be specified in accordance with the service conditions and the requirements concerning the performance of the structure.

## 6.2 Classification

### 6.2.1 General

Imposed loads shall be classified as free variable actions, unless otherwise specified in this standard.

<Note>
  For the classification of actions, see EN 1990:2023, 6.1.1
</Note>

If there is no risk of resonance or other significant dynamic response of the structure, imposed loads may be taken into account as quasi-static actions (see EN 1990:2023, 3.1.3.17).

<Warning>
  - For the treatment of the dynamic part of a quasi-static action, see EN 1990:2023, 7.1.3(5)
  - For synchronized rhythmic crowd loads, see 6.2.2
</Warning>

In case of risk of resonance or other significant dynamic response of the structure, imposed loads shall be classified as dynamic actions.

Resonance effects may be neglected if the accelerations are lower than the acceleration limits relevant for user comfort and functionality.

<Note>
  According to EN 1990, for specific types of structures or structural members having typical mass and damping properties, the acceleration limits can be assumed met when the natural frequency of vibrations is kept above appropriate values. For relevant limits and values, see EN 1990:2023, A.1.8.3.
</Note>

### 6.2.2 Additional provisions for dynamic actions

If resonance effects from synchronised rhythmic crowd loads cannot be neglected (see 6.2.1(4)), a more refined analysis of the dynamic response of the structure should be performed according to EN 1990, the relevant parts of EN 1991 and the other Eurocodes.

<Note>
  - See also EN 1990:2023, A.1.8.3
  - Further information on the procedure to be used for structures that are susceptible to dynamic excitation can be given in the National Annex
</Note>

When considering actions from forklifts and helicopters, the additional loadings due to masses and inertial forces caused by fluctuating effects should be considered.

<Info>
  Fluctuating effects are taken into account by a dynamic amplification factor φ which is applied to the static load values, as shown in Formula (6.4).
</Info>

## 6.3 Representation of actions

For the determination of the imposed loads, floor and roof areas in buildings should be sub-divided into categories according to their use, see 6.5.2.

## 6.4 Load arrangements

### 6.4.1 Floors, beams and roofs

For the design of a floor structure within one storey or a roof, the imposed load shall be taken into account as a free action applied at the most unfavourable part of the influence area of the action effects considered. For the other storeys, imposed loads may be assumed to be distributed uniformly (fixed actions) on the whole storey area.

<Note>
  - This is a simplified rule compared to the most critical ('chess board') loading arrangement
  - Characteristic values of uniformly distributed imposed loads are given in 6.5
</Note>

To ensure a minimum local resistance of the floor structure, a separate verification shall be performed with a concentrated load. Unless stated otherwise, the combination of such concentrated load with the uniformly distributed loads or other variable actions may be neglected.

<Note>
  Characteristic values of concentrated loads are given in 6.5.
</Note>

Imposed loads acting on floors, beams and roofs may be reduced by a reduction factor `αₐ` according to 6.5.3.2.

### 6.4.2 Columns and walls

For the design of columns and walls, the imposed load should be placed at all unfavourable locations in order to calculate the most adverse (combination of) effects of actions.

Where imposed loads from several storeys act on columns and walls, the maximum axial force may be calculated assuming the imposed loads on each storey to be uniformly distributed.

Where imposed loads from several storeys act on columns and walls, the imposed loads may be reduced by a factor `αₙ` according to 6.5.3.2.

## 6.5 Characteristic values of imposed loads

### 6.5.1 Field of application

This clause covers values of imposed loads on buildings due to:

- Normal use by persons
- Furniture and moveable objects (e.g. partitions, storage, the contents of containers)
- Vehicles
- Anticipating events, such as concentrations of persons or of furniture, or the moving or stacking of objects which may occur during reorganization or redecoration

The imposed loads specified in this part are modelled by uniformly distributed loads, line loads or concentrated loads or combinations of these loads.

<Warning>
  Heavy equipment (e.g. in communal kitchens, radiology rooms, boiler rooms, etc.) are not included in the loads given in this clause. Loads for heavy equipment should be as specified by the relevant authority or, where not specified, agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties.
</Warning>

### 6.5.2 Categories of use and characteristic values

Imposed loads on buildings shall be divided into categories according to the specific use of the area under consideration.

<Note>
  The categories are those given in Table 6.1 (NDP) unless the National Annex provides sub-categories and/or additional categories.
</Note>

Imposed loads shall be designed by using characteristic values `qₖ` (uniformly distributed load) and/or `Qₖ` (concentrated load).

<Info>
  - `qₖ` is intended for determination of general effects
  - `Qₖ` is intended for local effects and not expected to be combined with `qₖ` unless otherwise stated
  - See also 6.4.1(2) for local verifications
</Info>

The concentrated load `Qₖ` shall be considered to act at any point on the floor, roof, balcony, terrace, staircase over an area with a shape which is appropriate to their use and form.

<Note>
  The contact surface is normally assumed as a square, see Table 6.1 (NDP) for the dimension of the loaded area.
</Note>

Independent of this classification of areas, dynamic effects shall be considered where it is anticipated that the occupancy will cause significant dynamic effects.

<Note>
  See 6.2.2 for additional provisions on dynamic actions.
</Note>

## 6.5.3 Residential, social, commercial and administration areas (categories A to D)

### 6.5.3.1 Partitions treated as imposed loads

The self-weight of partitions may be taken into account by introducing a uniformly distributed load `qₖ,p` provided that the following conditions are verified:

- The relevant floor allows a sufficient distribution of a line load orthogonal to the intended orientation of the partition
- The self-weight of the partition is `Qₖ,p ≤ 3.0 kN/m` wall length

<Note>
  Partitions are elements other than structural; as such, according to 5.2(2), they are expected to be classified as permanent actions, typically free for their spatial variation. The simplified approach provided here only applies when the conditions defined above are verified. See section (4) for heavier partitions.
</Note>

The uniformly distributed load `qₖ,p` should be added to the imposed loads of floors obtained from 6.5.2(2).

The value of this uniformly distributed load `qₖ,p` for partitions with a self-weight `Qₖ,p ≤ 3.0 kN/m` wall length should be based on the self-weight of the partitions.

**Formula (6.1):**

```
qₖ,p = max{0.35 kN/m²; (0.4/m) Qₖ,p}
```

Where:

- `Qₖ,p` is expressed in kN/m wall length
- `qₖ,p` is expressed in kN/m²

<Note>
  The National Annex can set specific rules to derive the value of the uniformly distributed load `qₖ,p` for partitions with a self-weight `Qₖ,p > 3.0 kN/m` wall length.
</Note>

### 6.5.3.2 Reduction factors

The reduction factors `αₐ` and `αₙ` specified in this clause, which are applicable to the `qₖ` values for imposed loads, may be used if specified by the relevant authority, or, where not specified, as agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties.

<Info>
  - `αₐ` is the reduction factor relevant to imposed loads on floors, beams and roofs
  - `αₙ` is the reduction factor relevant to columns and walls depending on the number of storeys above such columns and walls
</Info>

The reduction factors `αₐ` and `αₙ` may be mutually combined when dealing with multi-storey buildings.

<Note>
  The reduction factors `αₐ` and `αₙ` can be mutually combined provided that the product `αₐ × αₙ` is not less than 0.50 unless the National Annex gives different rules.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The reduction factors `αₐ` and `αₙ` should not be applied for accidental and seismic design situations, including fire.
</Warning>

In accordance with 6.4.1(3) a reduction factor `αₐ` may be applied to the `qₖ` values for imposed loads for floors, beams and accessible roofs.

**Formula (6.2) - Area reduction factor:**

```
αₐ = 0.5 + 10/A ≤ 1.0
```

With the restriction for categories C and D: `αₐ ≥ 0.6`

Where A is the tributary area expressed in m².

<Note>
  For continuous structures, the reduction factor `αₐ` generally differs from span to span. As a simplification, the same value can apply uniformly using the maximum of the `αₐ` values calculated for different tributary areas.
</Note>

In accordance with 6.4.2(3) and provided that the area is classified according to Table 6.1 (NDP) into the categories A to D and T, for columns and walls the imposed loads on the floors supported by the column or wall under consideration may be multiplied by the reduction factor `αₙ`.

**Formula (6.3) - Number of floors reduction factor:**

```
αₙ = 0.7 + 0.6/n ≤ 1.0
```

Where `αₙ` is calculated for each floor considering the number of floors n above the column or wall under consideration.

When the imposed load is applied as an accompanying action in accordance with EN 1990, the combination of the factors ψ (EN 1990:2023, Table A.1.7) and `αₙ` may be considered.

<Note>
  The two factors ψ and `αₙ` can be combined, unless the National Annex gives different rules.
</Note>

### 6.5.3.3 Actions induced by forklifts

The vertical loads on floors due to traffic of forklifts shall be taken into account according to 6.5.4.2.

### 6.5.3.4 Grandstands and stages

Loadings on grandstands should take account of loads from spectators, fixed and movable equipment, and any dynamic loads caused by people dancing, jumping or moving in a synchronized manner.

<Note>
  For barrier and handrail loadings for grandstands, see 6.6.
</Note>

Specific loading requirements should be as specified by the relevant authority, or, where not specified, agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties.

For stage structures where the resonance effects can be neglected (see 6.2.1), the stage surface should be designed to withstand a minimum vertical static equivalent load and a simultaneous notional horizontal load applied to the stage surface at the node joints where vertical imposed loads are transferred to the vertical members.

<Note>
  - The minimum vertical static equivalent load is 5 kN/m² unless the National Annex gives a different value
  - The minimum notional horizontal load is 5% of the design vertical imposed load applied to the area of stage floor on which the activity takes place, unless the National Annex gives different values
  - The minimum notional horizontal load is 2.5% of the design vertical imposed load for other parts of the stage floor (for example areas used for workers and equipment) unless the National Annex gives a different value
  - The notional horizontal loads are typically applied in combination with wind loads and not combined with horizontal loads that take account of the geometric imperfections of frames
</Note>

## 6.5.4 Areas for archive, storage and industrial activities (category E)

### 6.5.4.1 Load model

The characteristic value of the imposed load in areas for storage and industrial activities shall be the maximum value taking account of the dynamic effects if appropriate. The loading arrangement shall be defined so that it produces the most unfavourable conditions allowed in use.

<Note>
  For transient design situations due to installation and reinstallation of machines, production units, etc. guidance is given in EN 1991-1-6.
</Note>

Any effects of filling and emptying should be taken into account.

The characteristic values of vertical loads in storage areas (category E1 in Table 6.1 (NDP)) should be derived by taking into account the specific weight and the upper design values for stacking heights. When stored material exerts horizontal forces on walls, etc. the horizontal force should be determined in accordance with EN 1991-4.

<Note>
  See Annex A for specific weights.
</Note>

Loads in industrial areas should be assessed considering the intended use and the equipment which is to be installed. Where equipment such as cranes, moving machinery, etc. are to be installed the effects on the structure should be determined in accordance with EN 1991-3.

Actions due to forklifts and transport vehicles should be considered as concentrated loads acting together with the appropriate imposed distributed loads given in Table 6.1 (NDP), see 6.5.4.2 and 6.5.4.3.

### 6.5.4.2 Actions induced by forklifts

Forklifts should be classified in six classes FL 1 to FL 6 depending on net weight, dimensions and hoisting loads, see Table 6.2.

#### Table 6.2 - Dimensions of forklift according to classes FL

| Class | Net weight [kN] | Hoisting load [kN] | Width of axle [m] | Overall width [m] | Overall length [m] |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| FL 1  | 21              | 10                 | 0.85              | 1.00              | 2.60               |
| FL 2  | 31              | 15                 | 0.95              | 1.10              | 3.00               |
| FL 3  | 44              | 25                 | 1.00              | 1.20              | 3.30               |
| FL 4  | 60              | 40                 | 1.20              | 1.40              | 4.00               |
| FL 5  | 90              | 60                 | 1.50              | 1.90              | 4.60               |
| FL 6  | 110             | 80                 | 1.80              | 2.30              | 5.10               |

The static characteristic value of the vertical axle load `Qₖ` of a forklift should be obtained from Table 6.3 depending on the forklift classes.

#### Table 6.3 - Axle loads of forklifts

| Class of forklifts | Axle load Qₖ [kN] |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| FL 1               | 26                |
| FL 2               | 40                |
| FL 3               | 63                |
| FL 4               | 90                |
| FL 5               | 140               |
| FL 6               | 170               |

The static characteristic value of the vertical axle load `Qₖ` should be increased by the dynamic amplification factor φ using Formula (6.4) to derive the characteristic value of the dynamic action `Qₖ,dyn`:

**Formula (6.4):**

```
Qₖ,dyn = φ Qₖ
```

<Note>
  The dynamic amplification factor φ for forklifts takes into account the inertial effects caused by acceleration and deceleration of the hoisting load.
</Note>

The dynamic factor φ for forklifts should be taken as:

- φ = 1.40 for pneumatic tyres
- φ = 2.00 for solid tyres

For forklifts having a net weight greater than 110 kN the loads should be defined by a more accurate analysis.

Horizontal loads due to acceleration or deceleration of forklifts may be taken as 30% of the vertical axle loads `Qₖ`. Dynamic factors may be neglected.

### 6.5.4.3 Actions induced by transport vehicles

The actions from transport vehicles that move on floors freely or guided by rails should be determined by a pattern of wheel loads.

The static values of the vertical wheel loads should be given based on gross vehicle weight. Their spectra should be used to define combination factors and fatigue loads.

The load arrangements including the vertical and horizontal wheel loads and the dimensions relevant for the design should be as specified by the relevant authority or, where not specified, agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties.

<Note>
  - Where relevant, see traffic load models from EN 1991-2
  - For accidental design situations where impact from vehicles or accidental loads from machines can be relevant, see EN 1991-1-7 and EN 1991-2
</Note>

### 6.5.4.4 Actions induced by special devices for maintenance

Special devices for maintenance should be modelled as loads from transportation vehicles, see 6.5.4.3.

The load arrangements including the vertical and horizontal wheel loads and the dimensions relevant for the design should be as specified by the relevant authority or, where not specified, agreed for a specific project by the relevant parties.

## 6.5.5 Garages and vehicle traffic areas (categories F and G)

The load model which should be used for garages and vehicle traffic areas (excluding ordinary roads and bridges) is a single axle with a load `Qₖ` with dimensions according to Figure 6.5 and/or a uniformly distributed load `qₖ`.

<Note>
  - The characteristic values for `qₖ` and `Qₖ` and the size of the loaded area, a, are given in Table 6.1 (NDP). See also 6.5.2(2)
  - Where areas are designed to category F or G, it can be relevant to control access of vehicles to those areas, for example by physical means or appropriate warning signs
</Note>

The axle load `Qₖ` should be in the possible positions which will produce the most adverse effects of the action.

## 6.5.6 Roofs (categories H to K)

### 6.5.6.1 General rules

For roofs, the simultaneity of imposed loads with climatic actions should be considered where appropriate.

<Note>
  The National Annex can set specific rules for treatment of simultaneity of imposed loads with climatic actions (particularly for category H roofs).
</Note>

### 6.5.6.2 Roofs not accessible except for normal maintenance and repair (category H)

For roofs of category H, the characteristic value `qₖ` shall be applied on a defined area `Aᵣₑf` of the roof at the most unfavourable position of the influence area of the action effects considered (see 6.4 for load arrangements).

<Note>
  - For category H, `qₖ` can be varied by the National Annex dependent upon the roof slope
  - The area `Aᵣₑf` is equal to 10 m² unless the National Annex gives a different value and specific rules to consider the maintenance and repair conditions that are expected
</Note>

### 6.5.6.3 Roofs accessible for special services (category K)

For roofs of category K, which are accessible for special services such as classes HC helicopter landing areas, to take account of dynamic effects during take-off and landing, the concentrated actions from helicopters on landing areas should be determined using Formula (6.4) and the dynamic amplification factor φ = 1.40.

<Note>
  - The dynamic amplification factor φ = 1.40 excludes accidental loadings, which are covered in EN 1991-1-7
  - `Qₖ` is taken from Table 6.4 (NDP) according to the class of the helicopter unless the National Annex gives different values
</Note>

#### Table 6.4 - Imposed loads on roofs of category K for helicopters

| Class of helicopter | Take-off load Q of helicopter | Take-off load Qₖ | Dimension of loaded area (m × m) |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| HC1                 | Q ≤ 20 kN                     | Qₖ = 20 kN       | 0.2 × 0.2                        |
| HC2                 | 20 kN \< Q ≤ 60 kN            | Qₖ = 60 kN       | 0.3 × 0.3                        |
| HC3                 | 60 kN \< Q ≤ 120 kN           | Qₖ = 120 kN      | 0.3 × 0.3                        |

### 6.5.6.4 Access ladders and walkways

Access ladders and walkways should be assumed to be loaded according to category H for a roof slope \< 20°.

For walkways which are part of a designated escape route, `qₖ` should be according to categories A to D as relevant.

For walkways for service, a minimum characteristic value `Qₖ` of 1.5 kN should be taken.

### 6.5.6.5 Frames and coverings of access hatches, supports of ceilings

The following loads should be used for the design of frames and coverings of access hatches (other than glazing), the supports of ceilings and similar structures:

- **Without access**: no imposed load
- **With access**: 0.25 kN/m² distributed over the whole area or the area supported, and the concentrated load of 0.9 kN so placed so as to produce maximum stresses in the affected member

## 6.5.7 Stairs and landings (category S)

The characteristic values for `qₖ` and `Qₖ` that are given in 6.5.2 should not be lower than the values of the adjacent areas, which give access to the stairs and landings under consideration.

## 6.5.8 Terraces and balconies (category T)

The characteristic values for `qₖ` and `Qₖ` that are given in 6.5.2 should not be lower than the values of the adjacent areas, which give access to the terrace or balcony under consideration.

<Note>
  Imposed loads on terraces and balconies are usually not applied with snow loads, see also 6.5.6.1 for simultaneity of imposed loads and climatic actions.
</Note>

## 6.6 Barrier loadings

### 6.6.1 General

Barriers should be designed for both horizontal and vertical imposed loads.

### 6.6.2 Horizontal loads

The characteristic values of the line load `qₖ` shall be applied at the height of the barriers (except guard rails for areas only accessible for maintenance and repair) but not higher than 1.2 m.

<Note>
  - The characteristic values of the line load `qₖ` are given in Table 6.5 (NDP) unless the National Annex gives different values
  - The National Annex can prescribe additional concentrated loads `Qₖ` and related loaded area, and/or hard or soft body impact specifications for analytical or experimental verification
</Note>

<Note>
  For areas of category E, the horizontal loads depend on the occupancy. Therefore, the value of `qₖ` is defined as a minimum value and should be checked for the specific occupancy and actual storage conditions.
</Note>

Guard rails for areas only accessible for maintenance and repair should be designed to resist a local horizontal load `Qₖ` at any point.

<Note>
  The value of `Qₖ` is 0.3 kN unless a different value is given in the National Annex.
</Note>

For areas susceptible to significant overcrowding associated with public events e.g. for sports stadiums, stands, stages, assembly halls or conference rooms, the line load should be taken according to category C5.

Barrier loadings for grandstands should be determined considering:

- The geometric arrangement of the structure
- Typical movements of spectators in a direction parallel or perpendicular to the barrier
- Specific areas of grandstands such as the front row, the rear of the stand, adjacent to the barrier and the standing area

### 6.6.3 Vertical loads

Barriers should be designed for a vertical load, which is either a concentrated load `Qₖ` or a uniformly distributed load `qₖ`, whichever gives the most adverse design condition in combination with the horizontal loading given in 6.6.2.

<Note>
  The value of `Qₖ` is 1 kN and the value for `qₖ` is 0.6 kN/m unless different values are given in the National Annex.
