### 0.1 Introduction to the Eurocodes

The Structural Eurocodes comprise the following standards generally consisting of a number of parts:

- EN 1990 Eurocode - Basis of structural and geotechnical design
- EN 1991 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures
- EN 1992 Eurocode 2 - Design of concrete structures
- EN 1993 Eurocode 3 - Design of steel structures
- EN 1994 Eurocode 4 - Design of composite steel and concrete structures
- EN 1995 Eurocode 5 - Design of timber structures
- EN 1996 Eurocode 6 - Design of masonry structures
- EN 1997 Eurocode 7 - Geotechnical design
- EN 1998 Eurocode 8 - Design of structures for earthquake resistance
- EN 1999 Eurocode 9 - Design of aluminium structures
- New parts are under development, e.g. Eurocode for design of structural glass

The Eurocodes are intended for use by designers, clients, manufacturers, constructors, relevant authorities (in exercising their duties in accordance with national or international regulations), educators, software developers, and committees drafting standards for related product, testing and execution standards.

NOTE Some aspects of design are most appropriately specified by relevant authorities or, where not specified, can be agreed on a project-specific basis between relevant parties such as designers and clients. The Eurocodes identify such aspects making explicit reference to relevant authorities and relevant parties.

### 0.2 Introduction to EN 1991 (all parts)

EN 1991 (all parts) specifies actions for the structural and geotechnical design of buildings, bridges and other civil engineering works, or parts thereof, including temporary structures, in conjunction with EN 1990 and the other Eurocodes.

EN 1991 does not cover the specific requirements of actions for seismic design. Provisions related to such requirements are given in EN 1998 (all parts), which complement and are consistent with EN 1991.

EN 1991 is also applicable to existing structures for:

- structural assessment;
- strengthening or repair;
- change of use.

NOTE 1 In these cases additional or amended provisions can be necessary.

EN 1991 is also applicable for the design of structures where materials or actions outside the scope of the other Eurocodes are involved.

NOTE 2 In this case additional or amended provisions can be necessary.
EN 1991 is subdivided in various parts:
EN 1991-1-1 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-1: Specific weight of materials, self-weight of construction works and imposed loads for buildings

EN 1991-1-2 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-2: Actions on structures exposed to fire
EN 1991-1-3 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-3: Snow Loads
EN 1991-1-4 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-4: Wind Actions
EN 1991-1-5 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-5: Thermal Actions
EN 1991-1-6 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-6: Actions during execution
EN 1991-1-7 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-7: Accidental actions
EN 1991-1-8 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-8: Actions from waves and currents on coastal structures

EN 1991-1-9 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-9: Atmospheric icing
EN 1991-2 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 2: Traffic loads on bridges and other civil engineering works

EN 1991-3 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 3: Actions induced by cranes and machines
EN 1991-4 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 4: Silos and tanks

### 0.3 Introduction to EN 1991-1-1

EN 1991-1-1 gives rules on the following aspects related to actions, which are relevant to the structural design of buildings and civil engineering works including some geotechnical aspects:

- specific weight of construction materials and stored materials;
- self-weight of construction works; and
- imposed loads for buildings.


### 0.4 Verbal forms used in the Eurocodes

The verb "shall" expresses a requirement strictly to be followed and from which no deviation is permitted in order to comply with the Eurocodes.

The verb "should" expresses a highly recommended choice or course of action. Subject to national regulation and/or any relevant contractual provisions, alternative approaches could be used/adopted where technically justified.
The verb "may" expresses a course of action permissible within the limits of the Eurocodes.
The verb "can" expresses possibility and capability; it is used for statements of fact and clarification of concepts.

### 0.5 National Annex for EN 1991-1-1

National choice is allowed in this standard where explicitly stated within notes. National choice includes the selection of values for Nationally Determined Parameters (NDPs).

The national standard implementing EN 1991-1-1 can have a National Annex containing all national choices to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the relevant country.

When no national choice is given, the default choice given in this standard is to be used.
When no national choice is made and no default is given in this standard, the choice can be specified by a relevant authority or, where not specified, agreed for a specific project by appropriate parties.

National choice is allowed in EN 1991-1-1 through notes to the following clauses:

| 5.4.3(1) | 5.4.3(2) - 2 choices | 5.4.3(3) | 5.4.3(4) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5.4.3(5) | 6.2.2(1) | 6.5.2(1) | 6.5.2(2) |
| 6.5.3.1(3) | 6.5.3.1(4) | 6.5.3.2(2) | 6.5.3.2(4) |
| 6.5.3.2(5) | 6.5.3.2(6) | 6.5.3.4(3) - 3 choices | 6.5.6.1(1) |
| 6.5.6.2(1) - 2 choices | 6.5.6.3(1) | 6.6.2(1) - 2 choices | 6.6.2(2) |
| 6.6.3(1) |  |  |  |

National choice is allowed in EN 1991-1-1 on the application of the following informative annex:
Annex A.

The National Annex can contain, directly or by reference, non-contradictory complementary information for ease of implementation, provided it does not alter any provisions of the Eurocodes.
