### 3.1 Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in EN 1990 and the following apply.

### 3.1.1 <br> angle of repose

angle which the natural slope of the sides of a heaped pile of loose material makes to the horizontal

### 3.1.2 <br> barrier

element that prevents people or moveable objects from horizontal movement or falling from the building or part of the building, and/or falling or moving through structural members or elements other than structural

Note 1 to entry: This includes all elements that fulfil this function in a building (e.g. handrails, parapets, balustrades, guard rails, partition walls acting as barriers, non-loadbearing separating walls, etc.).

### 3.1.3 <br> grandstand

large, often roofed structure that can include standing and/or seated accommodation for spectators at sporting or other events

### 3.1.4 <br> gross vehicle weight

self-weight of the vehicle together with the maximum weight it is permitted to carry

### 3.1.5 <br> imposed loads on buildings <br> loads arising from occupancy

### 3.1.6 <br> partition <br> non-load bearing wall

[^0]
### 3.1.7

## specific weight

overall weight per unit volume of a material, including a normal distribution of micro-voids, voids and pores

Note 1 to entry: In everyday usage this term is frequently called "density" (which is strictly mass per unit volume).

### 3.1.8

stage
structure that includes a performance area, which is used for a wide variety of functions at public and private events

### 3.1.9

## synchronised rhythmic crowd load

load induced by coordinated jumping and stamping
EXAMPLE load induced by spectators on grandstands at sporting events and concerts, coordinated jumping or dancing at fitness centres or similar

Note 1 to entry: Structures with elements subject to dancing and jumping are liable to inadvertent or deliberate synchronized movement of occupants, sometimes accompanied by music with a strong beat, such as occurs at pop concerts and aerobics events.

### 3.1.10

## tributary area

area whose loading is assumed to contribute to the loading on the structural member supporting that area

Note 1 to entry: The tributary area can change depending on the support conditions. An example of tributary areas for a beam supporting two single span one-way decks is given in Figure 3.1. An example of tributary areas for columns is given in Figure 3.2, which takes account of the continuity effects of the slab.

Note 2 to entry: On each floor, the sum of tributary areas equals the total area of the slab.
