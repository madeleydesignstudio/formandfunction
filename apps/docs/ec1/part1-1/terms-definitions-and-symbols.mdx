### 3.1 Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in EN 1990 and the following apply.

### 3.1.1
**angle of repose**

angle which the natural slope of the sides of a heaped pile of loose material makes to the horizontal

### 3.1.2
**barrier**

element that prevents people or moveable objects from horizontal movement or falling from the building or part of the building, and/or falling or moving through structural members or elements other than structural

Note 1 to entry: This includes all elements that fulfil this function in a building (e.g. handrails, parapets, balustrades, guard rails, partition walls acting as barriers, non-loadbearing separating walls, etc.).

### 3.1.3
**grandstand**

large, often roofed structure that can include standing and/or seated accommodation for spectators at sporting or other events

### 3.1.4
**gross vehicle weight**

self-weight of the vehicle together with the maximum weight it is permitted to carry

### 3.1.5
**imposed loads on buildings**

loads arising from occupancy

### 3.1.6
**partition**

non-load bearing wall

### 3.1.7
**specific weight**

overall weight per unit volume of a material, including a normal distribution of micro-voids, voids and pores

Note 1 to entry: In everyday usage this term is frequently called "density" (which is strictly mass per unit volume).

### 3.1.8
**stage**

structure that includes a performance area, which is used for a wide variety of functions at public and private events

### 3.1.9
**synchronised rhythmic crowd load**

load induced by coordinated jumping and stamping

EXAMPLE: load induced by spectators on grandstands at sporting events and concerts, coordinated jumping or dancing at fitness centres or similar

Note 1 to entry: Structures with elements subject to dancing and jumping are liable to inadvertent or deliberate synchronized movement of occupants, sometimes accompanied by music with a strong beat, such as occurs at pop concerts and aerobics events.

### 3.1.10
**tributary area**

area whose loading is assumed to contribute to the loading on the structural member supporting that area

Note 1 to entry: The tributary area can change depending on the support conditions. An example of tributary areas for a beam supporting two single span one-way decks is given in Figure 3.1. An example of tributary areas for columns is given in Figure 3.2, which takes account of the continuity effects of the slab.

Note 2 to entry: On each floor, the sum of tributary areas equals the total area of the slab.

**Figure 3.1 - Example of tributary area related to a beam (slabs are only spanning over one bay)**

Key:
- A₁₋₂: tributary area related to beam 1-2
- A₂₋₃: tributary area related to beam 2-3

**Figure 3.2 - Example of tributary area related to columns supporting a slab (two way spanning)**

Key:
- A₁: tributary area related to column 1
- A₂: tributary area related to column 2
- A₃: tributary area related to column 3
